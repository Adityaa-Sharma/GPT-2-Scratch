Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,

    Thy tribute wave deliver:

No more by thee my steps shall be,

    For ever and for ever.


Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,

    A rivulet then a river:

Nowhere by thee my steps shall be

    For ever and for ever.


But here will sigh thine alder tree

    And here thine aspen shiver;

And here by thee will hum the bee,

    For ever and for ever.


A thousand suns will stream on thee,

    A thousand moons will quiver;

But not by thee my steps shall be,

    For ever and for ever.

Poem 2: After-Thought

I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,

As being past away. -Vain sympathies!

For backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,

I see what was, and is, and will abide;

Still glides the Stream, and shall not cease to glide;

The Form remains, the Function never dies;

While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,

We Men, who in our morn of youth defied

The elements, must vanish; -be it so!

Enough, if something from our hands have power

To live, and act, and serve the future hour;

And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,

Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,

We feel that we are greater than we know.

Poem 3: All Things will Die

All Things will Die


Clearly the blue river chimes in its flowing


     Under my eye;

Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing


     Over the sky.

One after another the white clouds are fleeting;

Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating


     Full merrily;

  Yet all things must die.

The stream will cease to flow;

The wind will cease to blow;

The clouds will cease to fleet;

The heart will cease to beat;

  For all things must die.

     All things must die.

Spring will come never more.

     O, vanity!

Death waits at the door.

See! our friends are all forsaking

The wine and the merrymaking.

We are call’d–we must go.

Laid low, very low,

In the dark we must lie.

The merry glees are still;

The voice of the bird

Shall no more be heard,

Nor the wind on the hill.

     O, misery!

Hark! death is calling

While I speak to ye,

The jaw is falling,

The red cheek paling,

The strong limbs failing;

Ice with the warm blood mixing;

The eyeballs fixing.

Nine times goes the passing bell:

Ye merry souls, farewell.

     The old earth

     Had a birth,

     As all men know,

     Long ago.

And the old earth must die.

So let the warm winds range,

And the blue wave beat the shore;

For even and morn

Ye will never see

Thro’ eternity.

All things were born.

Ye will come never more,

For all things must die.

Poem 4: Amphion

MY father left a park to me,

     But it is wild and barren,

A garden too with scarce a tree,

     And waster than a warren:

Yet say the neighbours when they call,

     It is not bad but good land,

And in it is the germ of all

     That grows within the woodland.


O had I lived when song was great

     In days of old Amphion,

And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,

     Nor cared for seed or scion!

And had I lived when song was great,

     And legs of trees were limber,

And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,

     And fiddled in the timber!


'Tis said he had a tuneful tongue,

     Such happy intonation,

Wherever he sat down and sung

     He left a small plantation;

Wherever in a lonely grove

     He set up his forlorn pipes,

The gouty oak began to move,

     And flounder into hornpipes.


The mountain stirr'd its bushy crown,

     And, as tradition teaches,

Young ashes pirouetted down

     Coquetting with young beeches;

And briony-vine and ivy-wreath

     Ran forward to his rhyming,

And from the valleys underneath

     Came little copses climbing.


The linden broke her ranks and rent

     The woodbine wreaths that bind her,

And down the middle, buzz! she went

     With all her bees behind her:

The poplars, in long order due,

     With cypress promenaded,

The shock-head willows two and two

     By rivers gallopaded.


Came wet-shod alder from the wave,

     Came yews, a dismal coterie;

Each pluck'd his one foot from the grave,

     Poussetting with a sloe-tree:

Old elms came breaking from the vine,

     The vine stream'd out to follow,

And, sweating rosin, plump'd the pine

     From many a cloudy hollow.


And wasn't it a sight to see,

     When, ere his song was ended,

Like some great landslip, tree by tree,

     The country-side descended;

And shepherds from the mountain-eaves

     Look'd down, half-pleased, half-frighten'd,

As dash'd about the drunken leaves

     The random sunshine lighten'd!


Oh, nature first was fresh to men,

     And wanton without measure;

So youthful and so flexile then,

     You moved her at your pleasure.

Twang out, my fiddle! shake the twigs'

     And make her dance attendance;

Blow, flute, and stir the stiff-set sprigs,

     And scirrhous roots and tendons.


'Tis vain ! in such a brassy age

     I could not move a thistle;

The very sparrows in the hedge

     Scarce answer to my whistle;

'Or at the most, when three-parts-sick

     With strumming and with scraping,

A jackass heehaws from the rick,

     The passive oxen gaping.


But what is that I hear ? a sound

     Like sleepy counsel pleading;

O Lord !--'tis in my neighbour's ground,

     The modern Muses reading.

They read Botanic Treatises,

     And Works on Gardening thro' there,

And Methods of transplanting trees

     To look as if they grew there.


The wither'd Misses! how they prose

     O'er books of travell'd seamen,

And show you slips of all that grows

     From England to Van Diemen.

They read in arbours clipt and cut,

     And alleys, faded places,

By squares of tropic summer shut

     And warm'd in crystal cases.


But these, tho' fed with careful dirt,

     Are neither green nor sappy;

Half-conscious of the garden-squirt,

     The spindlings look unhappy.

Better to me the meanest weed

     That blows upon its mountain,

The vilest herb that runs to seed

     Beside its native fountain.


And I must work thro' months of toil,

     And years of cultivation,

Upon my proper patch of soil

     To grow my own plantation.

I'll take the showers as they fall,

     I will not vex my bosom:

Enough if at the end of all

     A little garden blossom.

Poem 5: Ask Me No More

Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea;

The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape,

With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;

But O too fond, when have I answer'd thee?

Ask me no more.


Ask me no more: what answer should I give?

I love not hollow cheek or faded eye:

Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!

Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live;

Ask me no more.


Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal'd:

I strove against the stream and all in vain:

Let the great river take me to the main:

No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;

Ask me no more.

Poem 6: Audley Court

‘The Bull, the Fleece are cramm’d, and not a room

For love or money. Let us picnic there

At Audley Court.’


 I spoke, while Audley feast


Humm’d like a hive all round the narrow quay,

To Francis, with a basket on his arm,

To Francis just alighted from the boat,

And breathing of the sea. ‘With all my heart,’

Said Francis. Then we shoulder’d thro’ the swarm,

And rounded by the stillness of the beach

To where the bay runs up its latest horn.


  We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp’d

The flat red granite; so by many a sweep

Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach’d

The griffin-guarded gates, and pass’d thro’ all

The pillar’d dusk of sounding sycamores,

And cross’d the garden to the gardener’s lodge,

With all its casements bedded, and its walls

And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.



  There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid

A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,

Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,

And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,

Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,

Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks

Imbedded and injellied; last, with these,

A flask of cider from his father’s vats,

Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat

And talk’d old matters over; who was dead,

Who married, who was like to be, and how

The races went, and who would rent the hall:

Then touch’d upon the game, how scarce it was

This season; glancing thence, discuss’d the farm,

The four-field system, and the price of grain;

And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,

And came again together on the king

With heated faces; till he laugh’d aloud;

And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung

To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang–



  ‘Oh! who would fight and march and countermarch,

Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field,

And shovell’d up into some bloody trench

Where no one knows? but let me live my life.

  ‘Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,

Perch’d like a crow upon a three-legg’d stool,

Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints

Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.

  ‘Who’d serve the state? for if I carved my name

Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,

I might as well have traced it in the sands;

The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.

  ‘Oh! who would love? I woo’d a woman once,

But she was sharper than an eastern wind,

And all my heart turn’d from her, as a thorn

Turns from the sea; but let me live my life.’



  He sang his song, and I replied with mine:

I found it in a volume, all of songs,

Knock’d down to me, when old Sir Robert’s pride,

His books–the more the pity, so I said–

Came to the hammer here in March–and this–

I set the words, and added names I knew.



  ‘Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep, and dream of me:

Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister’s arm,

And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.

  ‘Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia’s arm;

Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,

For thou art fairer than all else that is.

  ‘Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:

Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:

I go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.

  ‘I go, but I return: I would I were

The pilot of the darkness and the dream.

Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me.’



  So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,

The farmer’s son, who lived across the bay,

My friend; and I, that having wherewithal,

And in the fallow leisure of my life

A rolling stone of here and everywhere,

Did what I would; but ere the night we rose

And saunter’d home beneath a moon, that, just

In crescent, dimly rain’d about the leaf

Twilights of airy silver, till we reach’d

The limit of the hills; and as we sank

From rock to rock upon the glooming quay,

The town was hush’d beneath us: lower down

The bay was oily calm; the harbour-buoy,

Sole star of phosphorescence in the calm,

With one green sparkle ever and anon

Dipt by itself, and we were glad at heart.

Poem 7: ‘And ask ye why these sad tears stream?’

'And ask ye why these sad tears stream?'


‘Te somnia nostra reducunt.’

OVID.


And ask ye why these sad tears stream?

   Why these wan eyes are dim with weeping?

I had a dream–a lovely dream,

   Of her that in the grave is sleeping.


I saw her as ’twas yesterday,

   The bloom upon her cheek still glowing;

And round her play’d a golden ray,

   And on her brows were gay flowers blowing.


With angel-hand she swept a lyre,

   A garland red with roses bound it;

Its strings were wreath’d with lambent fire

   And amaranth was woven round it.


I saw her mid the realms of light,

   In everlasting radiance gleaming;

Co-equal with the seraphs bright,

   Mid thousand thousand angels beaming.


I strove to reach her, when, behold,

   Those fairy forms of bliss Elysian,

And all that rich scene wrapt in gold,

   Faded in air–a lovely vision!


And I awoke, but oh! to me

   That waking hour was doubly weary;

And yet I could not envy thee,

   Although so blest, and I so dreary.

Poem 8: Balin and Balan

Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot

In that first war, and had his realm restored

But rendered tributary, failed of late

To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called

His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,

'Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,

Lest we should set one truer on his throne.

Man's word is God in man.'

                         His Baron said

'We go but harken:  there be two strange knights                


Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,

A mile beneath the forest, challenging

And overthrowing every knight who comes.

Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,

And send them to thee?'

                      Arthur laughed upon him.

'Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,

Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,

Until they find a lustier than themselves.'


So these departed.  Early, one fair dawn,

The light-winged spirit of his youth returned

On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,

So coming to the fountain-side beheld

Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,

Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,

From underneath a plume of lady-fern,

Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.

And on the right of Balin Balin's horse

Was fast beside an alder, on the left

Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.

'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?'

Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake

Of glory; we be mightier men than all

In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;

For whatsoever knight against us came

Or I or he have easily overthrown.'

'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall,

But rather proven in his Paynim wars

Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,

Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.'

And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,

And lightly so returned, and no man knew.


Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside

The carolling water set themselves again,

And spake no word until the shadow turned;

When from the fringe of coppice round them burst

A spangled pursuivant, and crying 'Sirs,

Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,'

They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked

'Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?'

Balin the stillness of a minute broke

Saying 'An unmelodious name to thee,

Balin, "the Savage"--that addition thine--

My brother and my better, this man here,

Balan.  I smote upon the naked skull

A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand

Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard

He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath

Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.

I have not lived my life delightsomely:

For I that did that violence to thy thrall,

Had often wrought some fury on myself,

Saving for Balan:  those three kingless years

Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me.  King,

Methought that if we sat beside the well,

And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred

Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,

And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine

Than twenty Balins, Balan knight.  I have said.

Not so--not all.  A man of thine today

Abashed us both, and brake my boast.  Thy will?'

Said Arthur 'Thou hast ever spoken truth;

Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.

Rise, my true knight.  As children learn, be thou

Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move

To music with thine Order and the King.

Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands

Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!'


Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,

The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven

With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth

Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,

Along the walls and down the board; they sat,

And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,

Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon

Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made

Those banners of twelve battles overhead

Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host

Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.


Then Balan added to their Order lived

A wealthier life than heretofore with these

And Balin, till their embassage returned.


'Sir King' they brought report 'we hardly found,

So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall

Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once

A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed

Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm

Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King

Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;

And finds himself descended from the Saint

Arimathan Joseph; him who first

Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;

He boasts his life as purer than thine own;

Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;

Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets

Or dame or damsel enter at his gates

Lest he should be polluted.  This gray King

Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--

Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,

Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,

And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought

By holy Joseph thither, that same spear

Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.

He much amazed us; after, when we sought

The tribute, answered "I have quite foregone

All matters of this world:  Garlon, mine heir,

Of him demand it," which this Garlon gave

With much ado, railing at thine and thee.


'But when we left, in those deep woods we found

A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,

Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us

Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there

Reported of some demon in the woods

Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues

From all his fellows, lived alone, and came

To learn black magic, and to hate his kind

With such a hate, that when he died, his soul

Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life

Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,

Strikes from behind.  This woodman showed the cave

From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.

We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more.'


Then Arthur, 'Let who goes before me, see

He do not fall behind me:  foully slain

And villainously! who will hunt for me

This demon of the woods?'  Said Balan, 'I'!

So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,

Embracing Balin, 'Good my brother, hear!

Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone

Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,

Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,

Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream

That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.

Witness their flowery welcome.  Bound are they

To speak no evil.  Truly save for fears,

My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship

Would make me wholly blest:  thou one of them,

Be one indeed:  consider them, and all

Their bearing in their common bond of love,

No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,

No more of jealousy than in Paradise.'


So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:

Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away

From being knighted till he smote the thrall,

And faded from the presence into years

Of exile--now would strictlier set himself

To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,

Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round

Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile

In passing, and a transitory word

Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem

From being smiled at happier in themselves--

Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,

That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak

Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;

For one from out his village lately climed

And brought report of azure lands and fair,

Far seen to left and right; and he himself

Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet

Up from the base:  so Balin marvelling oft

How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,

Groaned, and at times would mutter, 'These be gifts,

Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,

Beyond MY reach.  Well had I foughten--well--

In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned

With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--

So--better!--But this worship of the Queen,

That honour too wherein she holds him--this,

This was the sunshine that hath given the man

A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,

And strength against all odds, and what the King

So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.

Her likewise would I worship an I might.

I never can be close with her, as he

That brought her hither.  Shall I pray the King

To let me bear some token of his Queen

Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget

My heats and violences? live afresh?

What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay

Being so stately-gentle, would she make

My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace

She greeted my return!  Bold will I be--

Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,

In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,

Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.'


And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said

'What wilt thou bear?' Balin was bold, and asked

To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,

Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,

Who answered 'Thou shalt put the crown to use.

The crown is but the shadow of the King,

And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,

So this will help him of his violences!'

'No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen,

But light to me! no shadow, O my King,

But golden earnest of a gentler life!'


So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights

Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world

Made music, and he felt his being move

In music with his Order, and the King.


The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,

Hath ever and anon a note so thin

It seems another voice in other groves;

Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,

The music in him seemed to change, and grow

Faint and far-off.

                 And once he saw the thrall

His passion half had gauntleted to death,

That causer of his banishment and shame,

Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:

His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:

The memory of that cognizance on shield

Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:


'Too high this mount of Camelot for me:

These high-set courtesies are not for me.

Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?

Fierier and stormier from restraining, break

Into some madness even before the Queen?'


Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,

And glancing on the window, when the gloom

Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame

That rages in the woodland far below,

So when his moods were darkened, court and King

And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall

Shadowed an angry distance:  yet he strove

To learn the graces of their Table, fought

Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.


Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat

Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.

A walk of roses ran from door to door;

A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:

And down that range of roses the great Queen

Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;

And all in shadow from the counter door

Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,

As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced

The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.

Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her 'Prince,

Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,

As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?'

To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,

'Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.'

'Yea so' she said 'but so to pass me by--

So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,

Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.

Let be:  ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.'


Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers

'Yea--for a dream.  Last night methought I saw

That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand

In yonder shrine.  All round her prest the dark,

And all the light upon her silver face

Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.

Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:

For see, how perfect-pure!  As light a flush

As hardly tints the blossom of the quince

Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.'


'Sweeter to me' she said 'this garden rose

Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still

The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.

Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers

In those fair days--not all as cool as these,

Though season-earlier.  Art thou sad? or sick?

Our noble King will send thee his own leech--

Sick? or for any matter angered at me?'


Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt

Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall:  her hue

Changed at his gaze:  so turning side by side

They past, and Balin started from his bower.


'Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.

Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.

My father hath begotten me in his wrath.

I suffer from the things before me, know,

Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;

A churl, a clown!' and in him gloom on gloom

Deepened:  he sharply caught his lance and shield,

Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,

But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.


He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw

The fountain where they sat together, sighed

'Was I not better there with him?' and rode

The skyless woods, but under open blue

Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough

Wearily hewing.  'Churl, thine axe!' he cried,

Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:

To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly

'Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods

If arm of flesh could lay him.'  Balin cried

'Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,

To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.'

'Nay' said the churl, 'our devil is a truth,

I saw the flash of him but yestereven.

And some DO say that our Sir Garlon too

Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.

Look to the cave.'  But Balin answered him

'Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,

Look to thy woodcraft,' and so leaving him,

Now with slack rein and careless of himself,

Now with dug spur and raving at himself,

Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;

So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm

Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,

The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks

Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,

Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night

Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.

He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all

Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,

Past eastward from the falling sun.  At once

He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud

And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,

Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.

Sideways he started from the path, and saw,

With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,

A light of armour by him flash, and pass

And vanish in the woods; and followed this,

But all so blind in rage that unawares

He burst his lance against a forest bough,

Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled

Far, till the castle of a King, the hall

Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped

With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;

The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,

The battlement overtopt with ivytods,

A home of bats, in every tower an owl.

Then spake the men of Pellam crying 'Lord,

Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?'

Said Balin 'For the fairest and the best

Of ladies living gave me this to bear.'

So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,

But found the greetings both of knight and King

Faint in the low dark hall of banquet:  leaves

Laid their green faces flat against the panes,

Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without

Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,

Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked

'Why wear ye that crown-royal?' Balin said

'The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,

As fairest, best and purest, granted me

To bear it!'  Such a sound (for Arthur's knights

Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes

The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears

A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,

Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.

'Fairest I grant her:  I have seen; but best,

Best, purest? THOU from Arthur's hall, and yet

So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these

So far besotted that they fail to see

This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?

Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.'


A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed

With holy Joseph's legend, on his right

Stood, all of massiest bronze:  one side had sea

And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:

And one was rough with wattling, and the walls

Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.

This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,

Through memory of that token on the shield

Relaxed his hold:  'I will be gentle' he thought

'And passing gentle' caught his hand away,

Then fiercely to Sir Garlon 'Eyes have I

That saw today the shadow of a spear,

Shot from behind me, run along the ground;

Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws

From homage to the best and purest, might,

Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,

Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure

To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,

Me, me of Arthur's Table.  Felon talk!

Let be! no more!'

                But not the less by night

The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,

Stung him in dreams.  At length, and dim through leaves

Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs

Whined in the wood.  He rose, descended, met

The scorner in the castle court, and fain,

For hate and loathing, would have past him by;

But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;

'What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?'

His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins

Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath

The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery 'Ha!

So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,'

Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew

Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.

Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,

And Balin by the banneret of his helm

Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry

Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,

A score with pointed lances, making at him--

He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,

Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet

Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked

The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide

And inward to the wall; he stept behind;

Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves

Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,

In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,

Beheld before a golden altar lie

The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,

Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon

Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,

Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;

Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side

The blindfold rummage buried in the walls

Might echo, ran the counter path, and found

His charger, mounted on him and away.

An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,

One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry

'Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things

With earthly uses'--made him quickly dive

Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile

Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,

Arising wearily at a fallen oak,

Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.


Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,

Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,

Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,

Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought

'I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,

Thee will I bear no more,' high on a branch

Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,

And there in gloom cast himself all along,

Moaning 'My violences, my violences!'


But now the wholesome music of the wood

Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,

A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode

The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.


'The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,

And kindled all the plain and all the wold.

The new leaf ever pushes off the old.

The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.


'Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--

Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world's desire,

Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!

The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.


'The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.

The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.

The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.

The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.


'The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,

And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,

But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!

The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!'


Then turning to her Squire 'This fire of Heaven,

This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,

And beat the cross to earth, and break the King

And all his Table.'

                  Then they reached a glade,

Where under one long lane of cloudless air

Before another wood, the royal crown

Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm

Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;

Amazed were these; 'Lo there' she cried--'a crown--

Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,

And there a horse! the rider? where is he?

See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.

Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping.  I will speak.

Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,

Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.

But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,

To help the weak.  Behold, I fly from shame,

A lustful King, who sought to win my love

Through evil ways:  the knight, with whom I rode,

Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire

Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,

Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,

Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,

To get me shelter for my maidenhood.

I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,

And by the great Queen's name, arise and hence.'


And Balin rose, 'Thither no more! nor Prince

Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed

The cognizance she gave me:  here I dwell

Savage among the savage woods, here die--

Die:  let the wolves' black maws ensepulchre

Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.

O me, that such a name as Guinevere's,

Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,

And been thereby uplifted, should through me,

My violence, and my villainy, come to shame.'


Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon

Sighed all as suddenly.  Said Balin to her

'Is this thy courtesy--to mock me, ha?

Hence, for I will not with thee.'  Again she sighed

'Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh

When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.

I knew thee wronged.  I brake upon thy rest,

And now full loth am I to break thy dream,

But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,

Though bitter.  Hither, boy--and mark me well.

Dost thou remember at Caerleon once--

A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--

Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--

By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--

Nay, truly we were hidden:  this fair lord,

The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt

In amorous homage--knelt--what else?--O ay

Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair

And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress

Had wandered from her own King's golden head,

And lost itself in darkness, till she cried--

I thought the great tower would crash down on both--

"Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,

Thou art my King."  This lad, whose lightest word

Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,

Saw them embrace:  he reddens, cannot speak,

So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,

The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven,

Cry out upon her.  Up then, ride with me!

Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would'st,

Do these more shame than these have done themselves.'


She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,

Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,

Breathed in a dismal whisper 'It is truth.'


Sunnily she smiled 'And even in this lone wood,

Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.

Fools prate, and perish traitors.  Woods have tongues,

As walls have ears:  but thou shalt go with me,

And we will speak at first exceeding low.

Meet is it the good King be not deceived.

See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,

From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like

Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen.'


She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,

He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,

Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,

Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,

Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him

Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,

The told-of, and the teller.

                           That weird yell,

Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,

Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there

(His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought

'The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!'

Then nearing 'Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,

And tramples on the goodly shield to show

His loathing of our Order and the Queen.

My quest, meseems, is here.  Or devil or man

Guard thou thine head.'  Sir Balin spake not word,

But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,

And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed

In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,

Reputed to be red with sinless blood,

Redded at once with sinful, for the point

Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked

The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse

Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,

Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man

Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.


Then to her Squire muttered the damsel 'Fools!

This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:

Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved

And thus foamed over at a rival name:

But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,

Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--

Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--

And yet hast often pleaded for my love--

See what I see, be thou where I have been,

Or else Sir Chick--dismount and loose their casques

I fain would know what manner of men they be.'

And when the Squire had loosed them, 'Goodly!--look!

They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,

And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,

Dead for one heifer!

                   Then the gentle Squire

'I hold them happy, so they died for love:

And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,

I too could die, as now I live, for thee.'


'Live on, Sir Boy,' she cried.  'I better prize

The living dog than the dead lion:  away!

I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead.'

Then leapt her palfrey o'er the fallen oak,

And bounding forward 'Leave them to the wolves.'


But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,

Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,

Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,

Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,

And on his dying brother cast himself

Dying; and HE lifted faint eyes; he felt

One near him; all at once they found the world,

Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail

And drawing down the dim disastrous brow

That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;


'O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died

To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.

Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why

Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?'


Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,

All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.


'Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam's hall:

This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.

And one said "Eat in peace! a liar is he,

And hates thee for the tribute!" this good knight

Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,

And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,

Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.

I well believe this damsel, and the one

Who stood beside thee even now, the same.

"She dwells among the woods" he said "and meets

And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell."

Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.

Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen."


'O brother' answered Balin 'woe is me!

My madness all thy life has been thy doom,

Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now

The night has come.  I scarce can see thee now.


Goodnight! for we shall never bid again

Goodmorrow--Dark my doom was here, and dark

It will be there.  I see thee now no more.

I would not mine again should darken thine,

Goodnight, true brother.

                       Balan answered low

'Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!

We two were born together, and we die

Together by one doom:' and while he spoke

Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep

With Balin, either locked in either's arm.

Poem 9: Battle Of Brunanburgh

Athelstan King,

      Lord among Earls,

      Bracelet-bestower and

      Baron of Barons,

      He with his brother,

      Edmund Atheling,

      Gaining a lifelong

      Glory in battle,

      Slew with the sword-edge

      There by Brunanburh,

      Brake the shield-wall,

      Hew'd the lindenwood,

      Hack'd the battleshield,

  Sons of Edward with hammer'd brands.


      Theirs was a greatness

      Got from their Grandsires--

      Theirs that so often in

      Strife with their enemies

  Struck for their hoards and their hearths and their homes.


       Bow'd the spoiler,

       Bent the Scotsman,

       Fell the shipcrews

       Doom'd to the death.

   All the field with blood of the fighters

       Flow'd, from when first the great

       Sun-star of morningtide,

       Lamp of the Lord God

       Lord everlasting,

   Glode over earth till the glorious creature

       Sank to his setting.

       There lay many a man

       Marr'd by the javelin,

       Men of the Northland

       Shot over shield.

       There was the Scotsman

       Weary of war.


       We the West-Saxons,

       Long as the daylight

       Lasted, in companies

    Troubled the track of the host that we hated;

    Grimly with swords that were sharp from the grindstone

    Fiercely we hack'd at the flyers before us.


       Mighty the Mercian,

       Hard was his hand-play,

       Sparing not any of

       Those that with Anlaf,

       Warriors over the

       Weltering waters

       Borne in the bark's-bosom,

       Drew to this island:

       Doom'd to the death.


      Five young kings put asleep by the sword-stroke,

    Seven strong earls of the army of Anlaf

    Fell on the war-field, numberless numbers,

    Shipmen and Scotsmen.


       Then the Norse leader,

       Dire was his need of it,

       Few were his following,

       Fled to his warship;

    Fleeted his vessel to sea with the king in it,

    Saving his life on the fallow flood.


       Also the crafty one,

       Constantinus,

       Crept to his north again,

       Hoar-headed hero!


       Slender warrant had

       He to be proud of

       The welcome of war-knives--

       He that was reft of his

       Folk and his friends that had

       Fallen in conflict,

       Leaving his son too

       Lost in the carnage,

       Mangled to morsels,

       A youngster in war!


       Slender reason had

       He to be glad of

       The clash of the war-glaive--

       Traitor and trickster

       And spurner of treaties--

       He nor had Anlaf

       With armies so broken

       A reason for bragging

       That they had the better

       In perils of battle

       On places of slaughter--

       The struggle of standards,

       The rush of the javelins,

       The crash of the charges,

       The wielding of weapons--

       The play that they play'd with

       The children of Edward.


       Then with their nail'd prows

       Parted the Norsemen, a

       Blood-redden'd relic of

       Javelins over

    The jarring breaker, the deep-sea billow,

    Shaping their way toward Dyflen again,

       Shamed in their souls.


       Also the brethren,

       King and Atheling,

       Each in his glory,

    Went to his own in his own West-Saxonland,

       Glad of the war.


       Many a carcase they left to be carrion,

    Many a livid one, many a sallow-skin--

       Left for the white-tail'd eagle to tear it, and

       Left for the horny-nibb'd raven to rend it, and

       Gave to the garbaging war-hawk to gorge it, and

       That gray beast, the wolf of the weald.


       Never had huger

       Slaughter of heroes

       Slain by the sword-edge--

       Such as old writers

       Have writ of in histories--

       Hapt in this isle, since

       Up from the East hither

       Saxon and Angle from

       Over the broad billow

       Broke into Britain with

       Haughty war-workers who

       Harried the Welshman, when

       Earls that were lured by the

       Hunger of glory gat

       Hold of the land.

  And snowy summits old in story:

  And the wild cataract leaps in glory.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.


  O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,

  And thinner, clearer, farther going!

  O sweet and far from cliff and scar

  The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!

Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.


  O love, they die in yon rich sky,

  They faint on hill or field or river:

  Our echoes roll from soul to soul,

  And grow for ever and for ever.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

Poem 12: Boadicea

While about the shore of Mona those Neronian legionaries

Burnt and broke the grove and altar of the Druid and Druidess,

Far in the East Boadicea, standing loftily charioted,

Mad and maddening all that heard her in her fierce volubility,

Girt by half the tribes of Britain, near the colony Camulodune,

Yell'd and shriek'd between her daughters o'er a wild confederacy.


 `They that scorn the tribes and call us Britain's barbarous populaces,

Did they hear me, would they listen, did they pity me supplicating?

Shall I heed them in their anguish? shall I brook to be supplicated?

Hear Icenian, Catieuchlanian, hear Coritanian, Trinobant!

Must their ever-ravening eagle's beak and talon annihilate us?

Tear the noble hear of Britain, leave it gorily quivering?

Bark an answer, Britain's raven! bark and blacken innumerable,

Blacken round the Roman carrion, make the carcase a skeleton,

Kite and kestrel, wolf and wolfkin, from the wilderness, wallow in it,

Till the face of Bel be brighten'd, Taranis be propitiated.

Lo their colony half-defended! lo their colony, Camulodune!

There the horde of Roman robbers mock at a barbarous adversary.

There the hive of Roman liars worship a gluttonous emperor-idiot.

Such is Rome, and this her deity: hear it, Spirit of Cassivelaun!


 `Hear it, Gods! the Gods have heard it, O Icenian, O Coritanian!

Doubt not ye the Gods have answer'd, Catieuchlanian, Trinobant.

These have told us all their anger in miraculous utterances,

Thunder, a flying fire in heaven, a murmur heard aerially,

Phantom sound of blows descending, moan of an enemy massacred,

Phantom wail of women and children, multitudinous agonies.

Bloodily flow'd the Tamesa rolling phantom bodies of horses and men;

Then a phantom colony smoulder'd on the refluent estuary;

Lastly yonder yester-even, suddenly giddily tottering--

There was one who watch'd and told me--down their statue of Victory fell.

Lo their precious Roman bantling, lo the colony Camulodune,

Shall we teach it a Roman lesson? shall we care to be pitiful?

Shall we deal with it as an infant? shall we dandle it amorously?


 `Hear Icenian, Catieuchlanian, hear Coritanian, Trinobant!

While I roved about the forest, long and bitterly meditating,

There I heard them in the darkness, at the mystical ceremony,

Loosely robed in flying raiment, sang the terrible prophetesses.

"Fear not, isle of blowing woodland, isle of silvery parapets!

Tho' the Roman eagle shadow thee, tho' the gathering enemy narrow thee,

Thou shalt wax and he shall dwindle, thou shalt be the mighty one yet!

Thine the liberty, thine the glory, thine the deeds to be celebrated,

Thine the myriad-rolling ocean, light and shadow illimitable,

Thine the lands of lasting summer, many-blossoming Paradises,

Thine the North and thine the South and thine the battle-thunder of God."

So they chanted: how shall Britain light upon auguries happier?

So they chanted in the darkness, and there cometh a victory now.


 Hear Icenian, Catieuchlanian, hear Coritanian, Trinobant!

Me the wife of rich Prasutagus, me the lover of liberty,

Me they seized and me they tortured, me they lash'd and humiliated,

Me the sport of ribald Veterans, mine of ruffian violators!

See they sit, they hide their faces, miserable in ignominy!

Wherefore in me burns an anger, not by blood to be satiated.

Lo the palaces and the temple, lo the colony Camulodune!

There they ruled, and thence they wasted all the flourishing territory,

Thither at their will they haled the yellow-ringleted Britoness--

Bloodily, bloodily fall the battle-axe, unexhausted, inexorable.

Shout Icenian, Catieuchlanian, shout Coritanian, Trinobant,

Till the victim hear within and yearn to hurry precipitously

Like the leaf in a roaring whirlwind, like the smoke in a hurricane whirl'd.

Lo the colony, there they rioted in the city of Cunobeline!

There they drank in cups of emerald, there at tables of ebony lay,

Rolling on their purple couches in their tender effeminacy.

There they dwelt and there they rioted; there--there--they dwell no more.

Burst the gates, and burn the palaces, break the works of the statuary,

Take the hoary Roman head and shatter it, hold it abominable,

Cut the Roman boy to pieces in his lust and voluptuousness,

Lash the maiden into swooning, me they lash'd and humiliated,

Chop the breasts from off the mother, dash the brains of the little one out,

Up my Britons, on my chariot, on my chargers, trample them under us.'


 So the Queen Boadicea, standing loftily charioted,

Brandishing in her hand a dart and rolling glances lioness-like,

Yell'd and shriek'd between her daughters in her fierce volubility.

Till her people all around the royal chariot agitated,

Madly dash'd the darts together, writhing barbarous lineaments,

Made the noise of frosty woodlands, when they shiver in January,

Roar'd as when the rolling breakers boom and blanch on the precipices,

Yell'd as when the winds of winter tear an oak on a promontory.

So the silent colony hearing her tumultuous adversaries

Clash the darts and on the buckler beat with rapid unanimous hand,

Thought on all her evil tyrannies, all her pitiless avarice,

Till she felt the heart within her fall and flutter tremulously,

Then her pulses at the clamoring of her enemy fainted away.

Out of evil evil flourishes, out of tyranny tyranny buds.

Ran the land with Roman slaughter, multitudinous agonies.

Perish'd many a maid and matron, many a valorous legionary.

Fell the colony, city, and citadel, London, Verulam, Camulodune.

By an Evolutionist



The Lord let the house of a brute to the soul of a man,

And the Lord–‘Not yet; but make it as clean as you can,

   And then I will let you a better.’

If my body come from brutes, my soul uncertain or a fable,

   Why not bask amid the senses while the sun of morning shines,

I, the finer brute rejoicing in my hounds, and in my stable,

   Youth and health, and birth and wealth, and choice of women and of wines?



II.


What hast thou done for me, grim Old Age, save breaking my bones on the rack?

   Would I had past in the morning that looks so bright from afar!



   OLD AGE


Done for thee? starved the wild beast that was linkt with thee eighty years back.

   Less weight now for the ladder-of-heaven that hangs on a star.



I.


If my body come from brutes, tho’ somewhat finer than their own,

   I am heir, and this my kingdom. Shall the royal voice be mute?

No, but if the rebel subject seek to drag me from the throne,

   Hold the sceptre, Human Soul, and rule thy province of the brute.



II.


I have climb’d to the snows of Age, and I gaze at a field in the Past.

   Where I sank with the body at times in the sloughs of a low desire,

But I hear no yelp of the beast, and the Man is quiet at last,

Poem 15: Claribel

Where Claribel low-lieth

     The breezes pause and die,

       Letting the rose-leaves fall:

 But the solemn oak-tree sigheth,

       Thick-leaved, ambrosial,

     With an ancient melody

   Of an inward agony,

Where Claribel low-lieth.


 At eve the beetle boometh

     Athwart the thicket lone:

 At noon the wild bee hummeth

     About the moss'd headstone:

 At midnight the moon cometh,

     And looketh down alone.

 Her song the lintwhite swelleth,

 The clear-voiced mavis dwelleth,

     The callow throstle lispeth,

 The slumbrous wave outwelleth,

     The babbling runnel crispeth,

 The hollow grot replieth

     Where Claribel low-lieth.

Poem 16: Come down, O Maid

COME down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:

What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang),

In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?

But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease

To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,

To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;

And come, for Love is of the valley, come,

For Love is of the valley, come thou down

And find him; by the happy threshold, he,

Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,

Or red with spirted purple of the vats,

Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk

With Death and Morning on the silver horns,

Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,

Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,

That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls

To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:

But follow; let the torrent dance thee down

To find him in the valley; let the wild

Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave

The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill

Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,

That like a broken purpose waste in air:

So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales

Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth

Arise to thee; the children call, and I

Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,

Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;

Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn,

The moan of doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumerable bees.

Poem 17: Come Into the Garden, Maud

Come into the garden, Maud,

    For the black bat, Night, has flown,

Come into the garden, Maud,

    I am here at the gate alone;

And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,

    And the musk of the roses blown.


For a breeze of morning moves,

    And the planet of Love is on high,

Beginning to faint in the light that she loves

    On a bed of daffodil sky,

To faint in the light of the sun she loves,

    To faint in his light, and to die.


All night have the roses heard

    The flute, violin, bassoon;

All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd

    To the dancers dancing in tune:

Till a silence fell with the waking bird,

    And a hush with the setting moon.


I said to the lily, "There is but one

    With whom she has heart to be gay.

When will the dancers leave her alone?

    She is weary of dance and play."

Now half to the setting moon are gone,

    And half to the rising day;

Low on the sand and loud on the stone

    The last wheel echoes away.


I said to the rose, "The brief night goes

    In babble and revel and wine.

O young lordlover, what sighs are those

    For one that will never be thine?

But mine, but mine," so I sware to the rose,

    "For ever and ever, mine."


And the soul of the rose went into my blood,

    As the music clash'd in the hall;

And long by the garden lake I stood,

    For I heard your rivulet fall

From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,

    Our wood, that is dearer than all;


From the meadow your walks have left so sweet

    That whenever a March-wind sighs

He sets the jewelprint of your feet

    In violets blue as your eyes,

To the woody hollows in which we meet

    And the valleys of Paradise.


The slender acacia would not shake

    One long milk-bloom on the tree;

The white lake-blossom fell into the lake,

    As the pimpernel dozed on the lea;

But the rose was awake all night for your sake,

    Knowing your promise to me;

The lilies and roses were all awake,

    They sigh'd for the dawn and thee.


Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls,

    Come hither, the dances are done,

In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,

    Queen lily and rose in one;

Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls,

    To the flowers, and be their sun.


There has fallen a splendid tear

    From the passion-flower at the gate.

She is coming, my dove, my dear;

    She is coming, my life, my fate;

The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;"

    And the white rose weeps, "She is late;"

The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"

    And the lily whispers, "I wait."


She is coming, my own, my sweet;

    Were it ever so airy a tread,

My heart would hear her and beat,

    Were it earth in an earthy bed;

My dust would hear her and beat,

    Had I lain for a century dead;

Would start and tremble under her feet,

    And blossom in purple and red.

Poem 18: Come Into the Garden, Maud II

O that 'twere possible

  After long grief and pain

  To find the arms of my true love

  Round me once again!



   When I was wont to meet her

  In the silent woody places

  By the home that gave me birth,

  We stood tranced in long embraces

  Mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter

  Than anything on earth.



   A shadow flits before me,

  Not thou, but like to thee:

  Ah Christ, that it were possible

  For one short hour to see

  The souls we loved, that they might tell us

  What and where they be.



   It leads me forth at evening,

  It lightly winds and steals

  In a cold white robe before me,

  When all my spirit reels

  At the shouts, the leagues of lights,

  And the roaring of the wheels.



   Half the night I waste in sighs,

  Half in dreams I sorrow after

  The delight of early skies;

  In a wakeful doze I sorrow

  For the hand, the lips, the eyes,

  For the meeting of the morrow,

  The delight of happy laughter,

  The delight of low replies.



   'Tis a morning pure and sweet,

  And a dewy splendour falls

  On the little flower that clings

  To the turrets and the walls;

  'Tis a morning pure and sweet,

  And the light and shadow fleet;

  She is walking in the meadow,

  And the woodland echo rings;

  In a moment we shall meet;

  She is singing in the meadow,

  And the rivulet at her feet

  Ripples on in light and shadow

  To the ballad that she sings.



   So I hear her sing as of old,

  My bird with the shining head,

  My own dove with the tender eye?

  But there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,

  There is some one dying or dead,

  And a sullen thunder is roll'd;

  For a tumult shakes the city,

  And I wake, my dream is fled;

  In the shuddering dawn, behold,

  Without knowledge, without pity,

  By the curtains of my bed

  That abiding phantom cold.



   Get thee hence, nor come again,

  Mix not memory with doubt,

  Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,

  Pass and cease to move about!

  'Tis the blot upon the brain

  That will show itself without.



   Then I rise, the eave-drops fall,

  And the yellow vapours choke

  The great city sounding wide;

  The day comes, a dull red ball

  Wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke

  On the misty river-tide.



   Thro' the hubbub of the market

  I steal, a wasted frame;

  It crosses here, it crosses there,

  Thro' all that crowd confused and loud,

  The shadow still the same;

  And on my heavy eyelids

  My anguish hangs like shame.



   Alas for her that met me,

  That heard me softly call,

  Came glimmering thro' the laurels

  At the quiet evenfall,

  In the garden by the turrets

  Of the old manorial hall.



   Would the happy spirit descend

  From the realms of light and song,

  In the chamber or the street,

  As she looks among the blest,

  Should I fear to greet my friend

  Or to say "Forgive the wrong,"

  Or to ask her, "Take me, sweet,

  To the regions of thy rest"?



   But the broad light glares and beats,

  And the shadow flits and fleets

  And will not let me be;

  And I loathe the squares and streets,

  And the faces that one meets,

  Hearts with no love for me:

  Always I long to creep

  Into some still cavern deep,

  There to weep, and weep, and weep

  My whole soul out to thee...

Poem 19: Come not when I am dead

Come not, when I am dead,

To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave,

To trample round my fallen head,

And vex the unhappy dust thou wouldst not save.

There let the wind sweep and the plover cry;

But thou, go by.


Child, if it were thine error or thy crime

I care no longer, being all unblest:

Wed whom thou wilt, but I am sick of Time,

And I desire to rest.

Pass on, weak heart, and leave to where I lie:

Go by, go by.

Till thy little wings are stronger.

So she rests a little longer,

Then she flies away.

Sunset and evening star,

  And one clear call for me!

And may there be no moaning of the bar,

  When I put out to sea,


But such a tide as moving seems asleep,

   Too full for sound and foam,

When that which drew from out the boundless deep

   Turns again home.


Twilight and evening bell,

And after that the dark!

And may there be no sadness of farewell,

   When I embark;


For through from out our bourne of Time and Place

   The flood may bear me far,

I hope to see my Pilot face to face

   When I have crossed the bar.

Poem 22: CXV: Spring

Now fades the last long streak of snow,

Now burgeons every maze of quick

About the flowering squares, and thick

By ashen roots the violets blow.


Now rings the woodland loud and long,

The distance takes a lovelier hue,

And drowned in yonder living blue

The lark becomes a sightless song.


Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,

The flocks are whiter down the vale,

And milkier every milky sail,

On winding stream or distant sea;


Where now the seamew pipes, or dives

In yonder greening gleam, and fly

The happy birds, that change their sky

To build and brood, that live their lives


From land to land; and in my breast

Spring wakens too: and my regret

Become an April violet,

And buds and blossoms like the rest.

Poem 23: Dedication

Dedication

These to His Memory--since he held them dear,

Perchance as finding there unconsciously

Some image of himself--I dedicate,

I dedicate, I consecrate with tears--

These Idylls.


            And indeed He seems to me

Scarce other than my king's ideal knight,

`Who reverenced his conscience as his king;

Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;

Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;

Who loved one only and who clave to her--'

Her--over all whose realms to their last isle,

Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,

The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,

Darkening the world.  We have lost him:  he is gone:

We know him now:  all narrow jealousies

Are silent; and we see him as he moved,

How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,

With what sublime repression of himself,

And in what limits, and how tenderly;

Not swaying to this faction or to that;

Not making his high place the lawless perch

Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground

For pleasure; but through all this tract of years

Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,

Before a thousand peering littlenesses,

In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,

And blackens every blot:  for where is he,

Who dares foreshadow for an only son

A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?

Or how should England dreaming of HIS sons

Hope more for these than some inheritance

Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,

Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,

Laborious for her people and her poor--

Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day--

Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste

To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace--

Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam

Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,

Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,

Beyond all titles, and a household name,

Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.


Break not, O woman's-heart, but still endure;

Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,

Remembering all the beauty of that star

Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made

One light together, but has past and leaves

The Crown a lonely splendour.


                            May all love,

His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow Thee,

The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,

The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,

The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,

Till God's love set Thee at his side again!

Poem 24: Demeter and Persephone

Faint as a climate-changing bird that flies

All night across the darkness, and at dawn

Falls on the threshold of her native land,

And can no more, thou camest, O my child,

Led upward by the God of ghosts and dreams,

Who laid thee at Eleusis, dazed and dumb,

With passing thro' at once from state to state,

Until I brought thee hither, that the day,

When here thy hands let fall the gather'd flower,

Might break thro' clouded memories once again

On thy lost self. A sudden nightingale

Saw thee, and flash'd into a frolic of song

And welcome; and a gleam as of the moon,

When first she peers along the tremulous deep,

Fled wavering o'er thy face, and chased away

That shadow of a likeness to the king

Of shadows, thy dark mate. Persephone!

Queen of the dead no more -- my child! Thine eyes

Again were human-godlike, and the Sun

Burst from a swimming fleece of winter gray,

And robed thee in his day from head to feet --

"Mother!" and I was folded in thine arms.


    Child, those imperial, disimpassion'd eyes

Awed even me at first, thy mother -- eyes

That oft had seen the serpent-wanded power

Draw downward into Hades with his drift

Of fickering spectres, lighted from below

By the red race of fiery Phlegethon;

But when before have Gods or men beheld

The Life that had descended re-arise,

And lighted from above him by the Sun?

So mighty was the mother's childless cry,

A cry that ran thro' Hades, Earth, and Heaven!


    So in this pleasant vale we stand again,

The field of Enna, now once more ablaze

With flowers that brighten as thy footstep falls,

All flowers -- but for one black blur of earth

Left by that closing chasm, thro' which the car

Of dark Aidoneus rising rapt thee hence.

And here, my child, tho' folded in thine arms,

I feel the deathless heart of motherhood

Within me shudder, lest the naked glebe

Should yawn once more into the gulf, and thence

The shrilly whinnyings of the team of Hell,

Ascending, pierce the glad and songful air,

And all at once their arch'd necks, midnight-maned,

Jet upward thro' the mid-day blossom. No!

For, see, thy foot has touch'd it; all the space

Of blank earth-baldness clothes itself afresh,

And breaks into the crocus-purple hour

That saw thee vanish.


         Child, when thou wert gone,

I envied human wives, and nested birds,

Yea, the cubb'd lioness; went in search of thee

Thro' many a palace, many a cot, and gave

Thy breast to ailing infants in the night,

And set the mother waking in amaze

To find her sick one whole; and forth again

Among the wail of midnight winds, and cried,

"Where is my loved one? Wherefore do ye wail?"

And out from all the night an answer shrill'd,

"We know not, and we know not why we wail."

I climb'd on all the cliffs of all the seas,

And ask'd the waves that moan about the world

"Where? do ye make your moaning for my child?"

And round from all the world the voices came

"We know not, and we know not why we moan."

"Where?" and I stared from every eagle-peak,

I thridded the black heart of all the woods,

I peer'd thro' tomb and cave, and in the storms

Of Autumn swept across the city, and heard

The murmur of their temples chanting me,

Me, me, the desolate Mother! "Where"? -- and turn'd,

And fled by many a waste, forlorn of man,

And grieved for man thro' all my grief for thee, --

The jungle rooted in his shatter'd hearth,

The serpent coil'd about his broken shaft,

The scorpion crawling over naked skulls; --

I saw the tiger in the ruin'd fane

Spring from his fallen God, but trace of thee

I saw not; and far on, and, following out

A league of labyrinthine darkness, came

On three gray heads beneath a gleaming rift.

"Where"? and I heard one voice from all the three

"We know not, for we spin the lives of men,

And not of Gods, and know not why we spin!

There is a Fate beyond us." Nothing knew.


    Last as the likeness of a dying man,

Without his knowledge, from him flits to warn

A far-off friendship that he comes no more,

So he, the God of dreams, who heard my cry,

Drew from thyself the likeness of thyself

Without thy knowledge, and thy shadow past

Before me, crying "The Bright one in the highest

Is brother of the Dark one in the lowest,

And Bright and Dark have sworn that I, the child

Of thee, the great Earth-Mother, thee, the Power

That lifts her buried life from loom to bloom,

Should be for ever and for evermore

The Bride of Darkness."


         So the Shadow wail'd.

Then I, Earth-Goddess, cursed the Gods of Heaven.

I would not mingle with their feasts; to me

Their nectar smack'd of hemlock on the lips,

Their rich ambrosia tasted aconite.

The man, that only lives and loves an hour,

Seem'd nobler than their hard Eternities.

My quick tears kill'd the flower, my ravings hush'd

The bird, and lost in utter grief I fail'd

To send my life thro' olive-yard and vine

And golden grain, my gift to helpless man.

Rain-rotten died the wheat, the barley-spears

Vere hollow-husk'd, the leaf fell, and the sun,

Pale at my grief, drew down before his time

Sickening, and that kept her winter snow.

    Then He, the brother of this Darkness, He

Who still is highest, glancing from his height

On earth a fruitless fallow, when he miss'd

The wonted steam of sacrifice, the praise

And prayer of men, decreed that thou should'st dwell

For nine white moons of each whole year with me,

Three dark ones in the shadow with thy King.


    Once more the reaper in the gleam of dawn

Will see me by the landmark far away,

Blessing his field, or seated in the dusk

Of even, by the lonely threshing-floor,

Rejoicing in the harvest and the grange.

    Yet I, Earth-Goddess, am but ill-content

With them, who still are highest. Those gray heads,

What meant they by their "Fate beyond the Fates"

But younger kindlier Gods to bear us down,

As we bore down the Gods before us? Gods,

To quench, not hurl the thunderbolt, to stay,

Not spread the plague, the famine; Gods indeed,

To send the noon into the night and break

The sunless halls of Hades into Heaven?

Till thy dark lord accept and love the Sun,

And all the Shadow die into the Light,

When thou shalt dwell the whole bright year with me,

And souls of men, who grew beyond their race,

And made themselves as Gods against the fear

Of Death and Hell; and thou that hast from men,

As Queen of Death, that worship which is Fear,

Henceforth, as having risen from out the dead,

Shalt ever send thy life along with mine

From buried grain thro' springing blade, and bless

Their garner'd Autumn also, reap with me,

Earth-mother, in the harvest hymns of Earth

The worship which is Love, and see no more

The Stone, the Wheel, the dimly-glimmering lawns

Of that Elysium, all the hateful fires

Of torment, and the shadowy warrior glide

Along the silent field of Asphodel.

Poem 26: Early Spring

Once more the Heavenly Power

Makes all things new,

And domes the red-plowed hills

With loving blue;

The blackbirds have their wills,

The throstles too.


Opens a door in Heaven;

From skies of glass

A Jacob's ladder falls

On greening grass,

And o'er the mountain-walls

Young angels pass.


Before them fleets the shower,

And burst the buds,

And shine the level lands,

And flash the floods;

The stars are from their hands

Flung through the woods,


The woods with living airs

How softly fanned,

Light airs from where the deep,

All down the sand,

Is breathing in his sleep,

Heard by the land.


O, follow, leaping blood,

The season's lure!

O heart, look down and up,

Serene, secure,

Warm as the crocus cup,

Like snow-drops, pure!


Past, Future glimpse and fade

Through some slight spell,

A gleam from yonder vale,

Some far blue fell;

And sympathies, how frail,

In sound and smell!


Till at thy chuckled note,

Thou twinkling bird,

The fairy fancies range,

And, lightly stirred,

Ring little bells of change

From word to word.


For now the Heavenly Power

Makes all things new,

And thaws the cold, and fills

The flower with dew;

The blackbirds have their wills,

The poets too.

Poem 27: Enoch Arden

Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;

And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;

Beyond, red roofs about a narrow wharf

In cluster; then a moulder'd church; and higher

A long street climbs to one tall-tower'd mill;

And high in heaven behind it a gray down

With Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,

By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes

Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.


 Here on this beach a hundred years ago,

Three children of three houses, Annie Lee,

The prettiest little damsel in the port,

And Philip Ray the miller's only son,

And Enoch Arden, a rough sailor's lad

Made orphan by a winter shipwreck, play'd

Among the waste and lumber of the shore,

Hard coils of cordage, swarthy fishing-nets,

Anchors of rusty fluke, and boats updrawn,

And built their castles of dissolving sand

To watch them overflow'd, or following up

And flying the white breaker, daily left

The little footprint daily wash'd away.


 A narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff:

In this the children play'd at keeping house.

Enoch was host one day, Philip the next,

While Annie still was mistress; but at times

Enoch would hold possession for a week:

`This is my house and this my little wife.'

`Mine too' said Philip `turn and turn about:'

When, if they quarrell'd, Enoch stronger-made

Was master: then would Philip, his blue eyes

All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears,

Shriek out `I hate you, Enoch,' and at this

The little wife would weep for company,

And pray them not to quarrel for her sake,

And say she would be little wife to both.


 But when the dawn of rosy childhood past,

And the new warmth of life's ascending sun

Was felt by either, either fixt his heart

On that one girl; and Enoch spoke his love,

But Philip loved in silence; and the girl

Seem'd kinder unto Philip than to him;

But she loved Enoch; tho' she knew it not,

And would if ask'd deny it.  Enoch set

A purpose evermore before his eyes,

To hoard all savings to the uttermost,

To purchase his own boat, and make a home

For Annie: and so prosper'd that at last

A luckier or a bolder fisherman,

A carefuller in peril, did not breathe

For leagues along that breaker-beaten coast

Than Enoch.  Likewise had he served a year

On board a merchantman, and made himself

Full sailor; and he thrice had pluck'd a life

From the dread sweep of the down-streaming seas:

And all me look'd upon him favorably:

And ere he touch'd his one-and-twentieth May

He purchased his own boat, and made a home

For Annie, neat and nestlike, halfway up

The narrow street that clamber'd toward the mill.


 Then, on a golden autumn eventide,

The younger people making holiday,

With bag and sack and basket, great and small,

Went nutting to the hazels.  Philip stay'd

(His father lying sick and needing him)

An hour behind; but as he climb'd the hill,

Just where the prone edge of the wood began

To feather toward the hollow, saw the pair,

Enoch and Annie, sitting hand-in-hand,

His large gray eyes and weather-beaten face

All-kindled by a still and sacred fire,

That burn'd as on an altar.  Philip look'd,

And in their eyes and faces read his doom;

Then, as their faces drew together, groan'd,

And slipt aside, and like a wounded life

Crept down into the hollows of the wood;

There, while the rest were loud in merrymaking,

Had his dark hour unseen, and rose and past

Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart.


 So these were wed, and merrily rang the bells,

And merrily ran the years, seven happy years,

Seven happy years of health and competence,

And mutual love and honorable toil;

With children; first a daughter.  In him woke,

With his first babe's first cry, the noble wish

To save all earnings to the uttermost,

And give his child a better bringing-up

Than his had been, or hers; a wish renew'd,

When two years after came a boy to be

The rosy idol of her solitudes,

While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,

Or often journeying landward; for in truth

Enoch's white horse, and Enoch's ocean-spoil

In ocean-smelling osier, and his face,

Rough-redden'd with a thousand winter gales,

Not only to the market-cross were known,

But in the leafy lanes behind the down,

Far as the portal-warding lion-whelp,

And peacock-yewtree of the lonely Hall,

Whose Friday fare was Enoch's ministering.


 Then came a change, as all things human change.

Ten miles to northward of the narrow port

Open'd a larger haven: thither used

Enoch at times to go by land or sea;

And once when there, and clambering on a mast

In harbor, by mischance he slipt and fell:

A limb was broken when they lifted him;

And while he lay recovering there, his wife

Bore him another son, a sickly one:

Another hand crept too across his trade

Taking her bread and theirs: and on him fell,

Altho' a grave and staid God-fearing man,

Yet lying thus inactive, doubt and gloom.

He seem'd, as in a nightmare of the night,

To see his children leading evermore

Low miserable lives of hand-to-mouth,

And her, he loved, a beggar: then he pray'd

`Save them from this, whatever comes to me.'

And while he pray'd, the master of that ship

Enoch had served in, hearing his mischance,

Came, for he knew the man and valued him,

Reporting of his vessel China-bound,

And wanting yet a boatswain.  Would he go?

There yet were many weeks before she sail'd,

Sail'd from this port.  Would Enoch have the place?

And Enoch all at once assented to it,

Rejoicing at that answer to his prayer.


 So now that the shadow of mischance appear'd

No graver than as when some little cloud

Cuts off the fiery highway of the sun,

And isles a light in the offing: yet the wife--

When he was gone--the children--what to do?

Then Enoch lay long-pondering on his plans;

To sell the boat--and yet he loved her well--

How many a rough sea had he weather'd in her!

He knew her, as a horseman knows his horse--

And yet to sell her--then with what she brought

Buy goods and stores--set Annie forth in trade

With all that seamen needed or their wives--

So might she keep the house while he was gone.

Should he not trade himself out yonder? go

This voyage more than once? yea twice or thrice--

As oft as needed--last, returning rich,

Become the master of a larger craft,

With fuller profits lead an easier life,

Have all his pretty young ones educated,

And pass his days in peace among his own.


 Thus Enoch in his heart determined all:

Then moving homeward came on Annie pale,

Nursing the sickly babe, her latest-born.

Forward she started with a happy cry,

And laid the feeble infant in his arms;

Whom Enoch took, and handled all his limbs,

Appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike,

But had no heart to break his purposes

To Annie, till the morrow, when he spoke.


 Then first since Enoch's golden ring had girt

Her finger, Annie fought against his will:

Yet not with brawling opposition she,

But manifold entreaties, many a tear,

Many a sad kiss by day and night renew'd

(Sure that all evil would come out of it)

Besought him, supplicating, if he cared

For here or his dear children, not to go.

He not for his own self caring but her,

Her and her children, let her plead in vain;

So grieving held his will, and bore it thro'.


 For Enoch parted with his old sea-friend,

Bought Annie goods and stores, and set his hand

To fit their little streetward sitting-room

With shelf and corner for the goods and stores.

So all day long till Enoch's last at home,

Shaking their pretty cabin, hammer and axe,

Auger and saw, while Annie seem'd to hear

Her own death-scaffold raising, shrill'd and rang,

Till this was ended, and his careful hand,--

The space was narrow,--having order'd all

Almost as neat and close as Nature packs

Her blossom or her seedling, paused; and he,

Who needs would work for Annie to the last,

Ascending tired, heavily slept till morn.


 And Enoch faced this morning of farewell

Brightly and boldly.  All his Annie's fears,

Save, as his Annie's, were a laughter to him.

Yet Enoch as a brave God-fearing man

Bow'd himself down, and in that mystery

Where God-in-man is one with man-in-God,

Pray'd for a blessing on his wife and babes

Whatever came to him: and then he said

`Annie, this voyage by the grace of God

Will bring fair weather yet to all of us.

Keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me,

For I'll be back, my girl, before you know it.'

Then lightly rocking baby's cradle `and he,

This pretty, puny, weakly little one,--

Nay--for I love him all the better for it--

God bless him, he shall sit upon my knees

And I will tell him tales of foreign parts,

And make him merry, when I come home again.

Come Annie, come, cheer up before I go.'


 Him running on thus hopefully she heard,

And almost hoped herself; but when he turn'd

The current of his talk to graver things

In sailor fashion roughly sermonizing

On providence and trust in Heaven, she heard,

Heard and not heard him; as the village girl,

Who sets her pitcher underneath the spring,

Musing on him that used to fill it for her,

Hears and not hears, and lets it overflow.


 At length she spoke `O Enoch, you are wise;

And yet for all your wisdom well know I

That I shall look upon your face no more.'


 `Well then,' said Enoch, `I shall look on yours.

Annie, the ship I sail in passes here

(He named the day) get you a seaman's glass,

Spy out my face, and laugh at all your fears.'


 But when the last of those last moments came,

`Annie my girl, cheer up, be comforted,

Look to the babes, and till I come again,

Keep everything shipshape, for I must go.

And fear no more for me; or if you fear

Cast all your cares on God; that anchor holds.

Is He not yonder in those uttermost

Parts of the morning? if I flee to these

Can I go from Him? and the sea is His,

The sea is His: He made it.'


   Enoch rose,

Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife,

And kiss'd his wonder-stricken little ones;

But for the third, sickly one, who slept

After a night of feverous wakefulness,

When Annie would have raised him Enoch said

`Wake him not; let him sleep; how should this child

Remember this?' and kiss'ed him in his cot.

But Annie from her baby's forehead clipt

A tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept

Thro' all his future; but now hastily caught

His bundle, waved his hand, and went his way.


 She when the day, that Enoch mention'd, came,

Borrow'd a glass, but all in vain: perhaps

She could not fix the glass to suit her eye;

Perhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;

She saw him not: and while he stood on deck

Waving, the moment and the vessel past.


 Ev'n to the last dip of the vanishing sail

She watch'd it, and departed weeping for him;

Then, tho' she mourn'd his absence as his grave,

Set her sad will no less to chime with his,

But throve not in her trade, not being bred

To barter, nor compensating the want

By shrewdness, neither capable of lies,

Nor asking overmuch and taking less,

And still foreboding `what would Enoch say?'

For more than once, in days of difficulty

And pressure, had she sold her wares for less

Than what she gave in buying what she sold:

She fail'd and sadden'd knowing it; and thus,

Expectant of that news that never came,

Gain'd for here own a scanty sustenance,

And lived a life of silent melancholy.


 Now the third child was sickly-born and grew

Yet sicklier, tho' the mother cared for it

With all a mother's care: nevertheless,

Whether her business often call'd her from it,

Or thro' the want of what it needed most,

Or means to pay the voice who best could tell

What most it needed--howsoe'er it was,

After a lingering,--ere she was aware,--

Like the caged bird escaping suddenly,

The little innocent soul flitted away.


 In that same week when Annie buried it,

Philip's true heart, which hunger'd for her peace

(Since Enoch left he had not look'd upon her),

Smote him, as having kept aloof so long.

`Surely' said Philip `I may see her now,

May be some little comfort;' therefore went,

Past thro' the solitary room in front,

Paused for a moment at an inner door,

Then struck it thrice, and, no one opening,

Enter'd; but Annie, seated with her grief,

Fresh from the burial of her little one,

Cared not to look on any human face,

But turn'd her own toward the wall and wept.

Then Philip standing up said falteringly

`Annie, I came to ask a favor of you.'


 He spoke; the passion in her moan'd reply

`Favor from one so sad and so forlorn

As I am!' half abash'd him; yet unask'd,

His bashfulness and tenderness at war,

He set himself beside her, saying to her:


 `I came to speak to you of what he wish'd,

Enoch, your husband: I have ever said

You chose the best among us--a strong man:

For where he fixt his heart he set his hand

To do the thing he will'd, and bore it thro'.

And wherefore did he go this weary way,

And leave you lonely? not to see the world--

For pleasure?--nay, but for the wherewithal

To give his babes a better bringing-up

Than his had been, or yours: that was his wish.

And if he come again, vext will he be

To find the precious morning hours were lost.

And it would vex him even in his grave,

If he could know his babes were running wild

Like colts about the waste.  So Annie, now--

Have we not known each other all our lives?

I do beseech you by the love you bear

Him and his children not to say me nay--

For, if you will, when Enoch comes again

Why then he shall repay me--if you will,

Annie--for I am rich and well-to-do.

Now let me put the boy and girl to school:

This is the favor that I came to ask.'


 Then Annie with her brows against the wall

Answer'd `I cannot look you in the face;

I seem so foolish and so broken down.

When you came in my sorrow broke me down;

And now I think your kindness breaks me down;

But Enoch lives; that is borne in on me:

He will repay you: money can be repaid;

Not kindness such as yours.'


          And Philip ask'd

`Then you will let me, Annie?'


   There she turn'd,

She rose, and fixt her swimming eyes upon him,

And dwelt a moment on his kindly face,

Then calling down a blessing on his head

Caught at his hand and wrung it passionately,

And past into the little garth beyond.

So lifted up in spirit he moved away.


 Then Philip put the boy and girl to school,

And bought them needful books, and everyway,

Like one who does his duty by his own,

Made himself theirs; and tho' for Annie's sake,

Fearing the lazy gossip of the port,

He oft denied his heart his dearest wish,

And seldom crost her threshold, yet he sent

Gifts by the children, garden-herbs and fruit,

The late and early roses from his wall,

Or conies from the down, and now and then,

With some pretext of fineness in the meal

To save the offence of charitable, flour

From his tall mill that whistled on the waste.


 But Philip did not fathom Annie's mind:

Scarce could the woman when he came upon her,

Out of full heart and boundless gratitude

Light on a broken word to thank him with.

But Philip was her children's all-in-all;

From distant corners of the street they ran

To greet his hearty welcome heartily;

Lords of his house and of his mill were they;

Worried his passive ear with petty wrongs

Or pleasures, hung upon him, play'd with him

And call'd him Father Philip.  Philip gain'd

As Enoch lost; for Enoch seem'd to them

Uncertain as a vision or a dream,

Faint as a figure seen in early dawn

Down at the far end of an avenue,

Going we know not where: and so ten years,

Since Enoch left his hearth and native land,

Fled forward, and no news of Enoch came.


 It chanced one evening Annie's children long'd

To go with others, nutting to the wood,

And Annie would go with them; then they begg'd

For Father Philip (as they call'd him) too:

Him, like the working bee in blossom-dust,

Blanch'd with his mill, they found; and saying to him

`Come with us Father Philip' he denied;

But when the children pluck'd at him to go,

He laugh'd, and yielding readily to their wish,

For was not Annie with them? and they went.


 But after scaling half the weary down,

Just where the prone edge of the wood began

To feather toward the hollow, all her force

Fail'd her; and sighing `let me rest' she said.

So Philip rested with her well-content;

While all the younger ones with jubilant cries

Broke from their elders, and tumultuously

Down thro' the whitening hazels made a plunge

To the bottom, and dispersed, and beat or broke

The lithe reluctant boughs to tear away

Their tawny clusters, crying to each other

And calling, here and there, about the wood.


 But Philip sitting at her side forgot

Her presence, and remember'd one dark hour

Here in this wood, when like a wounded life

He crept into the shadow: at last he said

Lifting his honest forehead `Listen, Annie,

How merry they are down yonder in the wood.'

`Tired, Annie?' for she did not speak a word.

`Tired?' but her face had fall'n upon her hands;

At which, as with a kind anger in him,

`The ship was lost' he said `the ship was lost!

No more of that! why should you kill yourself

And make them orphans quite?'  And Annie said

`I thought not of it: but--I known not why--

Their voices make me feel so solitary.'


 Then Philip coming somewhat closer spoke.

`Annie, there is a thing upon my mind,

And it has been upon my mind so long,

That tho' I know not when it first came there,

I know that it will out at last.  O Annie,

It is beyond all hope, against all chance,

That he who left you ten long years ago

Should still be living; well then--let me speak:

I grieve to see you poor and wanting help:

I cannot help you as I wish to do

Unless--they say that women are so quick--

Perhaps you know what I would have you know--

I wish you for my wife.  I fain would prove

A father to your children: I do think

They love me as a father: I am sure

That I love them as if they were mine own;

And I believe, if you were fast my wife,

That after all these sad uncertain years,

We might be still as happy as God grants

To any of His creatures.  Think upon it:

For I am well-to-do--no kin, no care,

No burthen, save my care for you and yours:

And we have known each other all our lives,

And I have loved you longer than you know.'


 Then answer'd Annie; tenderly she spoke:

`You have been as God's good angel in our house.

God bless you for it, God reward you for it,

Philip, with something happier than myself.

Can one live twice? can you be ever loved

As Enoch was? what is it that you ask?'

`I am content' he answer'd `to be loved

A little after Enoch.'  `O' she cried

Scared as it were `dear Philip, wait a while:

If Enoch comes--but Enoch will not come--

Yet wait a year, a year is not so long:

Surely I shall be wiser in a year:

O wait a little!'  Philip sadly said

`Annie, as I have waited all my life

I well may wait a little.'  `Nay' she cried

`I am bound: you have my promise--in a year:

Will you not bide your year as I bide mine?'

And Philip answer'd `I will bide my year.'


 Here both were mute, till Philip glancing up

Beheld the dead flame of the fallen day

Pass from the Danish barrow overhead;

Then fearing night and chill for Annie rose,

And sent his voice beneath him thro' the wood.

Up came the children laden with their spoil;

Then all descended to the port, and there

At Annie's door he paused and gave his hand,

Saying gently `Annie, when I spoke to you,

That was your hour of weakness.  I was wrong.

I am always bound to you, but you are free.'

Then Annie weeping answer'd `I am bound.'


 She spoke; and in one moment as it were,

While yet she went about her household ways,

Ev'n as she dwelt upon his latest words,

That he had loved her longer than she knew,

That autumn into autumn flash'd again,

And there he stood once more before her face,

Claiming her promise.  `Is it a year?' she ask'd.

`Yes, if the nuts' he said `be ripe again:

Come out and see.'  But she--she put him off--

So much to look to--such a change--a month--

Give her a month--she knew that she was bound--

A month--no more.  Then Philip with his eyes

Full of that lifelong hunger, and his voice

Shaking a little like a drunkard's hand,

`Take your own time, Annie, take your own time.'

And Annie could have wept for pity of him;

And yet she held him on delayingly

With many a scarce-believable excuse,

Trying his truth and his long-sufferance,

Till half-another year had slipt away.


 By this the lazy gossips of the port,

Abhorrent of a calculation crost,

Began to chafe as at a personal wrong.

Some thought that Philip did but trifle with her;

Some that she but held off to draw him on;

And others laugh'd at her and Philip too,

As simple folks that knew not their own minds;

And one, in whom all evil fancies clung

Like serpent eggs together, laughingly

Would hint a worse in either.  Her own son

Was silent, tho' he often look'd his wish;

But evermore the daughter prest upon her

To wed the man so dear to all of them

And lift the household out of poverty;

And Philip's rosy face contracting grew

Careworn and wan; and all these things fell on her

Sharp as reproach.


 At last one night it chanced

That Annie could not sleep, but earnestly

Pray'd for a sign `my Enoch is he gone?'

Then compass'd round by the blind wall of night

Brook'd not the expectant terror of her heart,

Started from bed, and struck herself a light,

Then desperately seized the holy Book,

Suddenly set it wide to find a sign,

Suddenly put her finger on the text,

`Under a palmtree.'  That was nothing to her:

No meaning there: she closed the book and slept:

When lo! her Enoch sitting on a height,

Under a palmtree, over him the Sun:

`He is gone' she thought `he is happy, he is singing

Hosanna in the highest: yonder shines

The Sun of Righteousness, and these be palms

Whereof the happy people strowing cried

"Hosanna in the highest!"'  Here she woke,

Resolved, sent for him and said wildly to him

`There is no reason why we should not wed.'

`Then for God's sake,' he answer'd, `both our sakes,

So you will wed me, let it be at once.'


 So these were wed and merrily rang the bells,

Merrily rang the bells and they were wed.

But never merrily beat Annie's heart.

A footstep seem'd to fall beside her path,

She knew not whence; a whisper in her ear,

She knew not what; nor loved she to be left

Alone at home, nor ventured out alone.

What ail'd her then, that ere she enter'd, often

Her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch,

Fearing to enter: Philip thought he knew:

Such doubts and fears were common to her state,

Being with child: but when her child was born,

Then her new child was as herself renew'd,

Then the new mother came about her heart,

Then her good Philip was her all-in-all,

And that mysterious instinct wholly died.


 And where was Enoch? prosperously sail'd

The ship `Good Fortune,' tho' at setting forth

The Biscay, roughly ridging eastward, shook

And almost overwhelm'd her, yet unvext

She slipt across the summer of the world,

Then after a long tumble about the Cape

And frequent interchange of foul and fair,

She passing thro' the summer world again,

The breath of heaven came continually

And sent her sweetly by the golden isles,

Till silent in her oriental haven.


 There Enoch traded for himself, and bought

Quaint monsters for the market of those times,

A gilded dragon, also, for the babes.


 Less lucky her home-voyage: at first indeed

Thro' many a fair sea-circle, day by day,

Scarce-rocking, her full-busted figure-head

Stared o'er the ripple feathering from her bows:

Then follow'd calms, and then winds variable,

Then baffling, a long course of them; and last

Storm, such as drove her under moonless heavens

Till hard upon the cry of `breakers' came

The crash of ruin, and the loss of all

But Enoch and two others.  Half the night,

Buoy'd upon floating tackle and broken spars,

These drifted, stranding on an isle at morn

Rich, but loneliest in a lonely sea.


 No want was there of human sustenance,

Soft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots;

Nor save for pity was it hard to take

The helpless life so wild that it was tame.

There in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge

They built, and thatch'd with leaves of palm, a hut,

Half hut, half native cavern.  So the three,

Set in this Eden of all plenteousness,

Dwelt with eternal summer, ill-content.


 For one, the youngest, hardly more than boy,

Hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck,

Lay lingering out a three-years' death-in-life.

They could not leave him.  After he was gone,

The two remaining found a fallen stem;

And Enoch's comrade, careless of himself,

Fire-hollowing this in Indian fashion, fell

Sun-stricken, and that other lived alone.

In those two deaths he read God's warning `wait.'


 The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns

And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,

The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes,

The lightning flash of insect and of bird,

The lustre of the long convolvuluses

That coil'd around the stately stems, and ran

Ev'n to the limit of the land, the glows

And glories of the broad belt of the world,

All these he saw; but what he fain had seen

He could not see, the kindly human face,

Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard

The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,

The league-long roller thundering on the reef,

The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd

And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep

Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,

As down the shore he ranged, or all day long

Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,

A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:

No sail from day to day, but every day

The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts

Among the palms and ferns and precipices;

The blaze upon the waters to the east;

The blaze upon his island overhead;

The blaze upon the waters to the west;

Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,

The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again

The scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.


 There often as he watch'd or seem'd to watch,

So still, the golden lizard on him paused,

A phantom made of many phantoms moved

Before him haunting him, or he himself

Moved haunting people, things and places, known

Far in a darker isle beyond the line;

The babes, their babble, Annie, the small house,

The climbing street, the mill, the leafy lanes,

The peacock-yewtree and the lonely Hall,

The horse he drove, the boat he sold, the chill

November dawns and dewy-glooming downs,

The gentle shower, the smell of dying leaves,

And the low moan of leaden-color'd seas.


 Once likewise, in the ringing of his ears,

Tho' faintly, merrily--far and far away--

He heard the pealing of his parish bells;

Then, tho' he knew not wherefore, started up

Shuddering, and when the beauteous hateful isle

Return'd upon him, had not his poor heart

Spoken with That, which being everywhere

Lets none, who speaks with Him, seem all alone,

Surely the man had died of solitude.


 Thus over Enoch's early-silvering head

The sunny and rainy seasons came and went

Year after year.  His hopes to see his own,

And pace the sacred old familiar fields,

Not yet had perish'd, when his lonely doom

Came suddenly to an end.  Another ship

(She wanted water) blown by baffling winds,

Like the Good Fortune, from her destined course,

Stay'd by this isle, not knowing where she lay:

For since the mate had seen at early dawn

Across a break on the mist-wreathen isle

The silent water slipping from the hills,

They sent a crew that landing burst away

In search of stream or fount, and fill'd the shores

With clamor.  Downward from his mountain gorge

Stept the long-hair'd long-bearded solitary,

Brown, looking hardly human, strangely clad,

Muttering and mumbling, idiotlike it seem'd,

With inarticulate rage, and making signs

They knew not what: and yet he led the way

To where the rivulets of sweet water ran;

And ever as he mingled with the crew,

And heard them talking, his long-bounden tongue

Was loosen'd, till he made them understand;

Whom, when their casks were fill'd they took aboard:

And there the tale he utter'd brokenly,

Scarce credited at first but more and more,

Amazed and melted all who listen'd to it:

And clothes they gave him and free passage home;

But oft he work'd among the rest and shook

His isolation from him.  None of these

Came from his county, or could answer him,

If question'd, aught of what he cared to know.

And dull the voyage was with long delays,

The vessel scarce sea-worthy; but evermore

His fancy fled before the lazy wind

Returning, till beneath a clouded moon

He like a lover down thro' all his blood

Drew in the dewy meadowy morning-breath

Of England, blown across her ghostly wall:

And that same morning officers and men

Levied a kindly tax upon themselves,

Pitying the lonely man, and gave him it:

Then moving up the coast they landed him,

Ev'n in that harbor whence he sail'd before.


 There Enoch spoke no word to anyone,

But homeward--home--what home? had he a home?

His home, he walk'd.  Bright was that afternoon,

Sunny but chill; till drawn thro' either chasm,

Where either haven open'd on the deeps,

Roll'd a sea-haze and whelm'd the world in gray;

Cut off the length of highway on before,

And left but narrow breadth to left and right

Of wither'd holt or tilth or pasturage.

On the nigh-naked tree the Robin piped

Disconsolate, and thro' the dripping haze

The dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down.

Thicker the drizzle grew, deeper the gloom;

Last, as it seem'd, a great mist-blotted light

Flared on him, and he came upon the place.


 Then down the long street having slowly stolen,

His heart foreshadowing all calamity,

His eyes upon the stones, he reach'd the home

Where Annie lived and loved him, and his babes

In those far-off seven happy years were born;

But finding neither light nor murmur there

(A bill of sale gleam'd thro' the drizzle) crept

Still downward thinking `dead or dead to me!'


 Down to the pool and narrow wharf he went,

Seeking a tavern which of old he knew,

A front of timber-crost antiquity,

So propt, worm-eaten, ruinously old,

He thought it must have gone; but he was gone

Who kept it; and his widow, Miriam Lane,

With daily-dwindling profits held the house;

A haunt of brawling seamen once, but now

Stiller, with yet a bed for wandering men.

There Enoch rested silently many days.


 But Miriam Lane was good and garrulous,

Nor let him be, but often breaking in,

Told him, with other annals of the port,

Not knowing--Enoch was so brown, so bow'd,

So broken--all the story of his house.

His baby's death, her growing poverty,

How Philip put her little ones to school,

And kept them in it, his long wooing her,

Her slow consent, and marriage, and the birth

Of Philip's child: and o'er his countenance

No shadow past, nor motion: anyone,

Regarding, well had deem'd he felt the tale

Less than the teller: only when she closed

`Enoch, poor man, was cast away and lost'

He, shaking his gray head pathetically,

Repeated muttering `cast away and lost;'

Again in deeper inward whispers `lost!'


   But Enoch yearn'd to see her face again;

`If I might look on her sweet face gain

And know that she is happy.'  So the thought

Haunted and harass'd him, and drove him forth,

At evening when the dull November day

Was growing duller twilight, to the hill.

There he sat down gazing on all below;

There did a thousand memories roll upon him,

Unspeakable for sadness.  By and by

The ruddy square of comfortable light,

Far-blazing from the rear of Philip's house,

Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures

The bird of passage, till he madly strikes

Against it, and beats out his weary life.


 For Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,

The latest house to landward; but behind,

With one small gate that open'd on the waste,

Flourish'd a little garden square and wall'd:

And in it throve an ancient evergreen,

A yewtree, and all round it ran a walk

Of shingle, and a walk divided it:

But Enoch shunn'd the middle walk and stole

Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence

That which he better might have shunn'd, if griefs

Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw.


 For cups and silver on the burnish'd board

Sparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:

And on the right hand of the hearth he saw

Philip, the slighted suitor of old times,

Stout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;

And o'er her second father stoopt a girl,

A later but a loftier Annie Lee,

Fair-hair'd and tall, and from her lifted hand

Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring

To tempt the babe, who rear'd his creasy arms,

Caught at and ever miss'd it, and they laugh'd:

And on the left hand of the hearth he saw

The mother glancing often toward her babe,

But turning now and then to speak with him,

Her son, who stood beside her tall and strong,

And saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.


 Now when the dead man come to life beheld

His wife his wife no more, and saw the babe

Hers, yet not his, upon the father's knee,

And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,

And his own children tall and beautiful,

And him, that other, reigning in his place,

Lord of his rights and of his children's love,--

Then he, tho' Miriam Lane had told him all,

Because things seen are mightier than things heard,

Stagger'd and shook, holding the branch, and fear'd

To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,

Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,

Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.


 He therefore turning softly like a thief,

Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,

And feeling all along the garden-wall,

Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,

Crept to the gate, and open'd it, and closed,

As lightly as a sick man's chamber-door,

Behind him, and came out upon the waste.


 And there he would have knelt, but that his knees

Were feeble, so that falling prone he dug

His fingers into the wet earth, and pray'd.


 `Too hard to bear! why did they take me hence?

O God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou

That didst uphold me on my lonely isle,

Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness

A little longer! aid me, give me strength

Not to tell her, never to let her know.

Help me no to break in upon her peace.

My children too! must I not speak to these?

They know me not.  I should betray myself.

Never: not father's kiss for me--the girl

So like her mother, and the boy, my son.'


 There speech and thought and nature fail'd a little,

And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced

Back toward his solitary home again,

All down the long and narrow street he went

Beating it in upon his weary brain,

As tho' it were the burthen of a song,

`Not to tell her, never to let her know.'


 He was not all unhappy.  His resolve

Upbore him, and firm faith, and evermore

Prayer from a living source within the will,

And beating up thro' all the bitter world,

Like fountains of sweet water in the sea,

Kept him a living soul.  `This miller's wife'

He said to Miriam `that you told me of,

Has she no fear that her first husband lives?'

`Ay ay, poor soul' said Miriam, `fear enow!

If you could tell her you had seen him dead,

Why, that would be her comfort;' and he thought

`After the Lord has call'd me she shall know,

I wait His time' and Enoch set himself,

Scorning an alms, to work whereby to live.

Almost to all things could he turn his hand.

Cooper he was and carpenter, and wrought

To make the boatmen fishing-nets, or help'd

At lading and unlading the tall barks,

That brought the stinted commerce of those days;

Thus earn'd a scanty living for himself:

Yet since he did but labor for himself,

Work without hope, there was not life in it

Whereby the man could live; and as the year

Roll'd itself round again to meet the day

When Enoch had return'd, a languor came

Upon him, gentle sickness, gradually

Weakening the man, till he could do no more,

But kept the house, his chair, and last his bed.

And Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully.

For sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck

See thro' the gray skirts of a lifting squall

The boat that bears the hope of life approach

To save the life despair'd of, than he saw

Death dawning on him, and the close of all.


 For thro' that dawning gleam'd a kindlier hope

On Enoch thinking `after I am gone,

Then may she learn I loved her to the last.'

He call'd aloud for Miriam Lane and said

`Woman, I have a secret--only swear,

Before I tell you--swear upon the book

Not to reveal it, till you see me dead.'

`Dead' clamor'd the good woman `hear him talk!

I warrant, man, that we shall bring you round.'

`Swear' add Enoch sternly `on the book.'

And on the book, half-frighted, Miriam swore.

Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,

`Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?'

`Know him?' she said `I knew him far away.

Ay, ay, I mind him coming down the street;

Held his head high, and cared for no man, he.'

Slowly and sadly Enoch answer'd her;

`His head is low, and no man cares for him.

I think I have not three days more to live;

I am the man.'  At which the woman gave

A half-incredulous, half-hysterical cry.

`You Arden, you! nay,--sure he was a foot

Higher than you be.'  Enoch said again

`My God has bow'd me down to what I am;

My grief and solitude have broken me;

Nevertheless, know that I am he

Who married--but that name has twice been changed--

I married her who married Philip Ray.

Sit, listen.'  Then he told her of his voyage,

His wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,

His gazing in on Annie, his resolve,

And how he kept it.  As the woman heard,

Fast flow'd the current of her easy tears,

While in her heart she yearn'd incessantly

To rush abroad all round the little haven,

Proclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes;

But awed and promise-bounded she forbore,

Saying only `See your bairns before you go!

Eh, let me fetch 'em, Arden,' and arose

Eager to bring them down, for Enoch hung

A moment on her words, but then replied.


 `Woman, disturb me not now at the last,

But let me hold my purpose till I die.

Sit down again; mark me and understand,

While I have power to speak.  I charge you now,

When you shall see her, tell her that I died

Blessing her, praying for her, loving her;

Save for the bar between us, loving her

As when she laid her head beside my own.

And tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw

So like her mother, that my latest breath

Was spent in blessing her and praying for her.

And tell my son that I died blessing him.

And say to Philip that I blest him too;

He never meant us any thing but good.

But if my children care to see me dead,

Who hardly saw me living, let them come,

I am their father; but she must not come,

For my dead face would vex her after-life.

And now there is but one of all my blood,

Who will embrace me in the world-to-be:

This hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,

And I have borne it with me all these years,

And thought to bear it with me to my grave;

But now my mind is changed, for I shall see him,

My babe in bliss: wherefore when I am gone,

Take, give her this, for it may comfort her:

It will moreover be a token to her,

That I am he.'


      He ceased; and Miriam Lane

Made such a voluble answer promising all,

That once again he roll'd his eyes upon her

Repeating all he wish'd, and once again

She promised.


     Then the third night after this,

While Enoch slumber'd motionless and pale,

And Miriam watch'd and dozed at intervals,

There came so loud a calling of the sea,

That all the houses in the haven rang.

He woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad

Crying with a loud voice `a sail! a sail!

I am saved'; and so fell back and spoke no more.


 So past the strong heroic soul away.

And when they buried him the little port

Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.

Poem 28: Far-Far-Away

(For Music)


What sight so lured him thro' the fields he knew

As where earth's green stole into heaven's own hue,

       Far--far--away?


What sound was dearest in his native dells?

The mellow lin-lan-lone of evening bells

       Far--far--away.


What vague world-whisper, mystic pain or joy,

Thro' those three words would haunt him when a boy,

       Far--far--away?


A whisper from his dawn of life? a breath

From some fair dawn beyond the doors of death

       Far--far--away?


Far, far, how far? from o'er the gates of birth,

The faint horizons, all the bounds of earth,

       Far--far--away?


What charm in words, a charm no words could give?

O dying words, can Music make you live

       Far--far--away?

Poem 29: Fatima

O LOVE, Love, Love! O withering might!

O sun, that from thy noonday height

Shudderest when I strain my sight,

Throbbing thro' all thy heat and light,

     Lo, falling from my constant mind,

     Lo, parch'd and wither'd, deaf and blind,

     I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.


Last night I wasted hateful hours

Below the city's eastern towers:

I thirsted for the brooks, the showers:

I roll'd among the tender flowers:

     I crush'd them on my breast, my mouth;

     I look'd athwart the burning drouth

     Of that long desert to the south.


Last night, when some one spoke his name,

From my swift blood that went and came

A thousand little shafts of flame

Were shiver'd in my narrow frame.

     O Love, O fire! once he drew

     With one long kiss my whole soul thro'

     My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.


Before he mounts the hill, I know

He cometh quickly: from below

Sweet gales, as from deep gardens, blow

Before him, striking on my brow.

     In my dry brain my spirit soon,

     Down-deepening from swoon to swoon,

     Faints like a daled morning moon.


The wind sounds like a silver wire,

And from beyond the noon a fire

Is pour'd upon the hills, and nigher

The skies stoop down in their desire;

     And, isled in sudden seas of light,

     My heart, pierced thro' with fierce delight,

     Bursts into blossom in his sight.


My whole soul waiting silently,

All naked in a sultry sky,

Droops blinded with his shining eye:

I will possess him or will die.

     I will grow round him in his place,

     Grow, live, die looking on his face,

     Die, dying clasp'd in his embrace.

Poem 30: Flower in the Crannied Wall

Flower in the crannied wall,

I pluck you out of the crannies,

I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,

Little flower--but if I could understand

What you are, root and all, all in all,

I should know what God and man is.

Poem 31: Gareth And Lynette

The last tall son of Lot and Bellicent,

And tallest, Gareth, in a showerful spring

Stared at the spate.  A slender-shafted Pine

Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.

'How he went down,' said Gareth, 'as a false knight

Or evil king before my lance if lance

Were mine to use--O senseless cataract,

Bearing all down in thy precipitancy--

And yet thou art but swollen with cold snows

And mine is living blood:  thou dost His will,

The Maker's, and not knowest, and I that know,

Have strength and wit, in my good mother's hall

Linger with vacillating obedience,

Prisoned, and kept and coaxed and whistled to--

Since the good mother holds me still a child!

Good mother is bad mother unto me!

A worse were better; yet no worse would I.

Heaven yield her for it, but in me put force

To weary her ears with one continuous prayer,

Until she let me fly discaged to sweep

In ever-highering eagle-circles up

To the great Sun of Glory, and thence swoop

Down upon all things base, and dash them dead,

A knight of Arthur, working out his will,

To cleanse the world.  Why, Gawain, when he came

With Modred hither in the summertime,

Asked me to tilt with him, the proven knight.

Modred for want of worthier was the judge.

Then I so shook him in the saddle, he said,

"Thou hast half prevailed against me," said so--he--

Though Modred biting his thin lips was mute,

For he is alway sullen:  what care I?'


And Gareth went, and hovering round her chair

Asked, 'Mother, though ye count me still the child,

Sweet mother, do ye love the child?'  She laughed,

'Thou art but a wild-goose to question it.'

'Then, mother, an ye love the child,' he said,

'Being a goose and rather tame than wild,

Hear the child's story.'  'Yea, my well-beloved,

An 'twere but of the goose and golden eggs.'


And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,

'Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine

Was finer gold than any goose can lay;

For this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid

Almost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm

As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.

And there was ever haunting round the palm

A lusty youth, but poor, who often saw

The splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought

"An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,

Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings."

But ever when he reached a hand to climb,

One, that had loved him from his childhood, caught

And stayed him, "Climb not lest thou break thy neck,

I charge thee by my love," and so the boy,

Sweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,

But brake his very heart in pining for it,

And past away.'


              To whom the mother said,

'True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,

And handed down the golden treasure to him.'


And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,

'Gold?' said I gold?--ay then, why he, or she,

Or whosoe'er it was, or half the world

Had ventured--HAD the thing I spake of been

Mere gold--but this was all of that true steel,

Whereof they forged the brand Excalibur,

And lightnings played about it in the storm,

And all the little fowl were flurried at it,

And there were cries and clashings in the nest,

That sent him from his senses:  let me go.'


Then Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,

'Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?

Lo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth

Lies like a log, and all but smouldered out!

For ever since when traitor to the King

He fought against him in the Barons' war,

And Arthur gave him back his territory,

His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there

A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,

No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.

And both thy brethren are in Arthur's hall,

Albeit neither loved with that full love

I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:

Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,

And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,

Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang

Of wrenched or broken limb--an often chance

In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,

Frights to my heart; but stay:  follow the deer

By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;

So make thy manhood mightier day by day;

Sweet is the chase:  and I will seek thee out

Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace

Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone year,

Till falling into Lot's forgetfulness

I know not thee, myself, nor anything.

Stay, my best son! ye are yet more boy than man.'


Then Gareth, 'An ye hold me yet for child,

Hear yet once more the story of the child.

For, mother, there was once a King, like ours.

The prince his heir, when tall and marriageable,

Asked for a bride; and thereupon the King

Set two before him.  One was fair, strong, armed--

But to be won by force--and many men

Desired her; one good lack, no man desired.

And these were the conditions of the King:

That save he won the first by force, he needs

Must wed that other, whom no man desired,

A red-faced bride who knew herself so vile,

That evermore she longed to hide herself,

Nor fronted man or woman, eye to eye--

Yea--some she cleaved to, but they died of her.

And one--they called her Fame; and one,--O Mother,

How can ye keep me tethered to you--Shame.

Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.

Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,

Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--

Else, wherefore born?'


                     To whom the mother said

'Sweet son, for there be many who deem him not,

Or will not deem him, wholly proven King--

Albeit in mine own heart I knew him King,

When I was frequent with him in my youth,

And heard him Kingly speak, and doubted him

No more than he, himself; but felt him mine,

Of closest kin to me:  yet--wilt thou leave

Thine easeful biding here, and risk thine all,

Life, limbs, for one that is not proven King?

Stay, till the cloud that settles round his birth

Hath lifted but a little.  Stay, sweet son.'


And Gareth answered quickly, 'Not an hour,

So that ye yield me--I will walk through fire,

Mother, to gain it--your full leave to go.

Not proven, who swept the dust of ruined Rome

From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed

The Idolaters, and made the people free?

Who should be King save him who makes us free?'


So when the Queen, who long had sought in vain

To break him from the intent to which he grew,

Found her son's will unwaveringly one,

She answered craftily, 'Will ye walk through fire?

Who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke.

Ay, go then, an ye must:  only one proof,

Before thou ask the King to make thee knight,

Of thine obedience and thy love to me,

Thy mother,--I demand.


                     And Gareth cried,

'A hard one, or a hundred, so I go.

Nay--quick! the proof to prove me to the quick!'


But slowly spake the mother looking at him,

'Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur's hall,

And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks

Among the scullions and the kitchen-knaves,

And those that hand the dish across the bar.

Nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone.

And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day.'


For so the Queen believed that when her son

Beheld his only way to glory lead

Low down through villain kitchen-vassalage,

Her own true Gareth was too princely-proud

To pass thereby; so should he rest with her,

Closed in her castle from the sound of arms.


Silent awhile was Gareth, then replied,

'The thrall in person may be free in soul,

And I shall see the jousts.  Thy son am I,

And since thou art my mother, must obey.

I therefore yield me freely to thy will;

For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself

To serve with scullions and with kitchen-knaves;

Nor tell my name to any--no, not the King.'


Gareth awhile lingered.  The mother's eye

Full of the wistful fear that he would go,

And turning toward him wheresoe'er he turned,

Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour,

When wakened by the wind which with full voice

Swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn,

He rose, and out of slumber calling two

That still had tended on him from his birth,

Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.


The three were clad like tillers of the soil.

Southward they set their faces.  The birds made

Melody on branch, and melody in mid air.

The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green,

And the live green had kindled into flowers,

For it was past the time of Easterday.


So, when their feet were planted on the plain

That broadened toward the base of Camelot,

Far off they saw the silver-misty morn

Rolling her smoke about the Royal mount,

That rose between the forest and the field.

At times the summit of the high city flashed;

At times the spires and turrets half-way down

Pricked through the mist; at times the great gate shone

Only, that opened on the field below:

Anon, the whole fair city had disappeared.


Then those who went with Gareth were amazed,

One crying, 'Let us go no further, lord.

Here is a city of Enchanters, built

By fairy Kings.'  The second echoed him,

'Lord, we have heard from our wise man at home

To Northward, that this King is not the King,

But only changeling out of Fairyland,

Who drave the heathen hence by sorcery

And Merlin's glamour.'  Then the first again,

'Lord, there is no such city anywhere,

But all a vision.'


                 Gareth answered them

With laughter, swearing he had glamour enow

In his own blood, his princedom, youth and hopes,

To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian sea;

So pushed them all unwilling toward the gate.

And there was no gate like it under heaven.

For barefoot on the keystone, which was lined

And rippled like an ever-fleeting wave,

The Lady of the Lake stood:  all her dress

Wept from her sides as water flowing away;

But like the cross her great and goodly arms

Stretched under the cornice and upheld:

And drops of water fell from either hand;

And down from one a sword was hung, from one

A censer, either worn with wind and storm;

And o'er her breast floated the sacred fish;

And in the space to left of her, and right,

Were Arthur's wars in weird devices done,

New things and old co-twisted, as if Time

Were nothing, so inveterately, that men

Were giddy gazing there; and over all

High on the top were those three Queens, the friends

Of Arthur, who should help him at his need.


Then those with Gareth for so long a space

Stared at the figures, that at last it seemed

The dragon-boughts and elvish emblemings

Began to move, seethe, twine and curl:  they called

To Gareth, 'Lord, the gateway is alive.'


And Gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes

So long, that even to him they seemed to move.

Out of the city a blast of music pealed.

Back from the gate started the three, to whom

From out thereunder came an ancient man,

Long-bearded, saying, 'Who be ye, my sons?'


Then Gareth, 'We be tillers of the soil,

Who leaving share in furrow come to see

The glories of our King:  but these, my men,

(Your city moved so weirdly in the mist)

Doubt if the King be King at all, or come

From Fairyland; and whether this be built

By magic, and by fairy Kings and Queens;

Or whether there be any city at all,

Or all a vision:  and this music now

Hath scared them both, but tell thou these the truth.'


Then that old Seer made answer playing on him

And saying, 'Son, I have seen the good ship sail

Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens,

And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air:

And here is truth; but an it please thee not,

Take thou the truth as thou hast told it me.

For truly as thou sayest, a Fairy King

And Fairy Queens have built the city, son;

They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft

Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,

And built it to the music of their harps.

And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son,

For there is nothing in it as it seems

Saving the King; though some there be that hold

The King a shadow, and the city real:

Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass

Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become

A thrall to his enchantments, for the King

Will bind thee by such vows, as is a shame

A man should not be bound by, yet the which

No man can keep; but, so thou dread to swear,

Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide

Without, among the cattle of the field.

For an ye heard a music, like enow

They are building still, seeing the city is built

To music, therefore never built at all,

And therefore built for ever.'


                             Gareth spake

Angered, 'Old master, reverence thine own beard

That looks as white as utter truth, and seems

Wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall!

Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been

To thee fair-spoken?'


                    But the Seer replied,

'Know ye not then the Riddling of the Bards?

"Confusion, and illusion, and relation,

Elusion, and occasion, and evasion"?

I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,

And all that see thee, for thou art not who

Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.

And now thou goest up to mock the King,

Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie.'


Unmockingly the mocker ending here

Turned to the right, and past along the plain;

Whom Gareth looking after said, 'My men,

Our one white lie sits like a little ghost

Here on the threshold of our enterprise.

Let love be blamed for it, not she, nor I:

Well, we will make amends.'


                          With all good cheer

He spake and laughed, then entered with his twain

Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces

And stately, rich in emblem and the work

Of ancient kings who did their days in stone;

Which Merlin's hand, the Mage at Arthur's court,

Knowing all arts, had touched, and everywhere

At Arthur's ordinance, tipt with lessening peak

And pinnacle, and had made it spire to heaven.

And ever and anon a knight would pass

Outward, or inward to the hall:  his arms

Clashed; and the sound was good to Gareth's ear.

And out of bower and casement shyly glanced

Eyes of pure women, wholesome stars of love;

And all about a healthful people stept

As in the presence of a gracious king.


Then into hall Gareth ascending heard

A voice, the voice of Arthur, and beheld

Far over heads in that long-vaulted hall

The splendour of the presence of the King

Throned, and delivering doom--and looked no more--

But felt his young heart hammering in his ears,

And thought, 'For this half-shadow of a lie

The truthful King will doom me when I speak.'

Yet pressing on, though all in fear to find

Sir Gawain or Sir Modred, saw nor one

Nor other, but in all the listening eyes

Of those tall knights, that ranged about the throne,

Clear honour shining like the dewy star

Of dawn, and faith in their great King, with pure

Affection, and the light of victory,

And glory gained, and evermore to gain.

Then came a widow crying to the King,

'A boon, Sir King!  Thy father, Uther, reft

From my dead lord a field with violence:

For howsoe'er at first he proffered gold,

Yet, for the field was pleasant in our eyes,

We yielded not; and then he reft us of it

Perforce, and left us neither gold nor field.'


Said Arthur, 'Whether would ye? gold or field?'

To whom the woman weeping, 'Nay, my lord,

The field was pleasant in my husband's eye.'


And Arthur, 'Have thy pleasant field again,

And thrice the gold for Uther's use thereof,

According to the years.  No boon is here,

But justice, so thy say be proven true.

Accursed, who from the wrongs his father did

Would shape himself a right!'


                            And while she past,

Came yet another widow crying to him,

'A boon, Sir King!  Thine enemy, King, am I.

With thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord,

A knight of Uther in the Barons' war,

When Lot and many another rose and fought

Against thee, saying thou wert basely born.

I held with these, and loathe to ask thee aught.

Yet lo! my husband's brother had my son

Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead;

And standeth seized of that inheritance

Which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son.

So though I scarce can ask it thee for hate,

Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,

Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son.'


Then strode a good knight forward, crying to him,

'A boon, Sir King!  I am her kinsman, I.

Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man.'


Then came Sir Kay, the seneschal, and cried,

'A boon, Sir King! even that thou grant her none,

This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall--

None; or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag.'


But Arthur, 'We sit King, to help the wronged

Through all our realm.  The woman loves her lord.

Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hates!

The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames,

Aurelius Emrys would have scourged thee dead,

And Uther slit thy tongue:  but get thee hence--

Lest that rough humour of the kings of old

Return upon me!  Thou that art her kin,

Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,

But bring him here, that I may judge the right,

According to the justice of the King:

Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King

Who lived and died for men, the man shall die.'


Then came in hall the messenger of Mark,

A name of evil savour in the land,

The Cornish king.  In either hand he bore

What dazzled all, and shone far-off as shines

A field of charlock in the sudden sun

Between two showers, a cloth of palest gold,

Which down he laid before the throne, and knelt,

Delivering, that his lord, the vassal king,

Was even upon his way to Camelot;

For having heard that Arthur of his grace

Had made his goodly cousin, Tristram, knight,

And, for himself was of the greater state,

Being a king, he trusted his liege-lord

Would yield him this large honour all the more;

So prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold,

In token of true heart and felty.


Then Arthur cried to rend the cloth, to rend

In pieces, and so cast it on the hearth.

An oak-tree smouldered there.  'The goodly knight!

What! shall the shield of Mark stand among these?'

For, midway down the side of that long hall

A stately pile,--whereof along the front,

Some blazoned, some but carven, and some blank,

There ran a treble range of stony shields,--

Rose, and high-arching overbrowed the hearth.

And under every shield a knight was named:

For this was Arthur's custom in his hall;

When some good knight had done one noble deed,

His arms were carven only; but if twain

His arms were blazoned also; but if none,

The shield was blank and bare without a sign

Saving the name beneath; and Gareth saw

The shield of Gawain blazoned rich and bright,

And Modred's blank as death; and Arthur cried

To rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth.


'More like are we to reave him of his crown

Than make him knight because men call him king.

The kings we found, ye know we stayed their hands

From war among themselves, but left them kings;

Of whom were any bounteous, merciful,

Truth-speaking, brave, good livers, them we enrolled

Among us, and they sit within our hall.

But as Mark hath tarnished the great name of king,

As Mark would sully the low state of churl:

And, seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold,

Return, and meet, and hold him from our eyes,

Lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead,

Silenced for ever--craven--a man of plots,

Craft, poisonous counsels, wayside ambushings--

No fault of thine:  let Kay the seneschal

Look to thy wants, and send thee satisfied--

Accursed, who strikes nor lets the hand be seen!'


And many another suppliant crying came

With noise of ravage wrought by beast and man,

And evermore a knight would ride away.


Last, Gareth leaning both hands heavily

Down on the shoulders of the twain, his men,

Approached between them toward the King, and asked,

'A boon, Sir King (his voice was all ashamed),

For see ye not how weak and hungerworn

I seem--leaning on these? grant me to serve

For meat and drink among thy kitchen-knaves

A twelvemonth and a day, nor seek my name.

Hereafter I will fight.'


                       To him the King,

'A goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon!

But so thou wilt no goodlier, then must Kay,

The master of the meats and drinks, be thine.'


He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien

Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself

Root-bitten by white lichen,


                           'Lo ye now!

This fellow hath broken from some Abbey, where,

God wot, he had not beef and brewis enow,

However that might chance! but an he work,

Like any pigeon will I cram his crop,

And sleeker shall he shine than any hog.'


Then Lancelot standing near, 'Sir Seneschal,

Sleuth-hound thou knowest, and gray, and all the hounds;

A horse thou knowest, a man thou dost not know:

Broad brows and fair, a fluent hair and fine,

High nose, a nostril large and fine, and hands

Large, fair and fine!--Some young lad's mystery--

But, or from sheepcot or king's hall, the boy

Is noble-natured.  Treat him with all grace,

Lest he should come to shame thy judging of him.'


Then Kay, 'What murmurest thou of mystery?

Think ye this fellow will poison the King's dish?

Nay, for he spake too fool-like:  mystery!

Tut, an the lad were noble, he had asked

For horse and armour:  fair and fine, forsooth!

Sir Fine-face, Sir Fair-hands? but see thou to it

That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day

Undo thee not--and leave my man to me.'


So Gareth all for glory underwent

The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage;

Ate with young lads his portion by the door,

And couched at night with grimy kitchen-knaves.

And Lancelot ever spake him pleasantly,

But Kay the seneschal, who loved him not,

Would hustle and harry him, and labour him

Beyond his comrade of the hearth, and set

To turn the broach, draw water, or hew wood,

Or grosser tasks; and Gareth bowed himself

With all obedience to the King, and wrought

All kind of service with a noble ease

That graced the lowliest act in doing it.

And when the thralls had talk among themselves,

And one would praise the love that linkt the King

And Lancelot--how the King had saved his life

In battle twice, and Lancelot once the King's--

For Lancelot was the first in Tournament,

But Arthur mightiest on the battle-field--

Gareth was glad.  Or if some other told,

How once the wandering forester at dawn,

Far over the blue tarns and hazy seas,

On Caer-Eryri's highest found the King,

A naked babe, of whom the Prophet spake,

'He passes to the Isle Avilion,

He passes and is healed and cannot die'--

Gareth was glad.  But if their talk were foul,

Then would he whistle rapid as any lark,

Or carol some old roundelay, and so loud

That first they mocked, but, after, reverenced him.

Or Gareth telling some prodigious tale

Of knights, who sliced a red life-bubbling way

Through twenty folds of twisted dragon, held

All in a gap-mouthed circle his good mates

Lying or sitting round him, idle hands,

Charmed; till Sir Kay, the seneschal, would come

Blustering upon them, like a sudden wind

Among dead leaves, and drive them all apart.

Or when the thralls had sport among themselves,

So there were any trial of mastery,

He, by two yards in casting bar or stone

Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,

So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,

Would hurry thither, and when he saw the knights

Clash like the coming and retiring wave,

And the spear spring, and good horse reel, the boy

Was half beyond himself for ecstasy.


So for a month he wrought among the thralls;

But in the weeks that followed, the good Queen,

Repentant of the word she made him swear,

And saddening in her childless castle, sent,

Between the in-crescent and de-crescent moon,

Arms for her son, and loosed him from his vow.


This, Gareth hearing from a squire of Lot

With whom he used to play at tourney once,

When both were children, and in lonely haunts

Would scratch a ragged oval on the sand,

And each at either dash from either end--

Shame never made girl redder than Gareth joy.

He laughed; he sprang.  'Out of the smoke, at once

I leap from Satan's foot to Peter's knee--

These news be mine, none other's--nay, the King's--

Descend into the city:' whereon he sought

The King alone, and found, and told him all.


'I have staggered thy strong Gawain in a tilt

For pastime; yea, he said it:  joust can I.

Make me thy knight--in secret! let my name

Be hidden, and give me the first quest, I spring

Like flame from ashes.'


                      Here the King's calm eye

Fell on, and checked, and made him flush, and bow

Lowly, to kiss his hand, who answered him,

'Son, the good mother let me know thee here,

And sent her wish that I would yield thee thine.

Make thee my knight? my knights are sworn to vows

Of utter hardihood, utter gentleness,

And, loving, utter faithfulness in love,

And uttermost obedience to the King.'


Then Gareth, lightly springing from his knees,

'My King, for hardihood I can promise thee.

For uttermost obedience make demand

Of whom ye gave me to, the Seneschal,

No mellow master of the meats and drinks!

And as for love, God wot, I love not yet,

But love I shall, God willing.'


                              And the King

'Make thee my knight in secret? yea, but he,

Our noblest brother, and our truest man,

And one with me in all, he needs must know.'


'Let Lancelot know, my King, let Lancelot know,

Thy noblest and thy truest!'


                           And the King--

'But wherefore would ye men should wonder at you?

Nay, rather for the sake of me, their King,

And the deed's sake my knighthood do the deed,

Than to be noised of.'


                     Merrily Gareth asked,

'Have I not earned my cake in baking of it?

Let be my name until I make my name!

My deeds will speak:  it is but for a day.'

So with a kindly hand on Gareth's arm

Smiled the great King, and half-unwillingly

Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him.

Then, after summoning Lancelot privily,

'I have given him the first quest:  he is not proven.

Look therefore when he calls for this in hall,

Thou get to horse and follow him far away.

Cover the lions on thy shield, and see

Far as thou mayest, he be nor ta'en nor slain.'


Then that same day there past into the hall

A damsel of high lineage, and a brow

May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom,

Hawk-eyes; and lightly was her slender nose

Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower;

She into hall past with her page and cried,


'O King, for thou hast driven the foe without,

See to the foe within! bridge, ford, beset

By bandits, everyone that owns a tower

The Lord for half a league.  Why sit ye there?

Rest would I not, Sir King, an I were king,

Till even the lonest hold were all as free

From cursd bloodshed, as thine altar-cloth

From that best blood it is a sin to spill.'


'Comfort thyself,' said Arthur.  'I nor mine

Rest:  so my knighthood keep the vows they swore,

The wastest moorland of our realm shall be

Safe, damsel, as the centre of this hall.

What is thy name? thy need?'


                           'My name?' she said--

'Lynette my name; noble; my need, a knight

To combat for my sister, Lyonors,

A lady of high lineage, of great lands,

And comely, yea, and comelier than myself.

She lives in Castle Perilous:  a river

Runs in three loops about her living-place;

And o'er it are three passings, and three knights

Defend the passings, brethren, and a fourth

And of that four the mightiest, holds her stayed

In her own castle, and so besieges her

To break her will, and make her wed with him:

And but delays his purport till thou send

To do the battle with him, thy chief man

Sir Lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow,

Then wed, with glory:  but she will not wed

Save whom she loveth, or a holy life.

Now therefore have I come for Lancelot.'


Then Arthur mindful of Sir Gareth asked,

'Damsel, ye know this Order lives to crush

All wrongers of the Realm.  But say, these four,

Who be they?  What the fashion of the men?'


'They be of foolish fashion, O Sir King,

The fashion of that old knight-errantry

Who ride abroad, and do but what they will;

Courteous or bestial from the moment, such

As have nor law nor king; and three of these

Proud in their fantasy call themselves the Day,

Morning-Star, and Noon-Sun, and Evening-Star,

Being strong fools; and never a whit more wise

The fourth, who alway rideth armed in black,

A huge man-beast of boundless savagery.

He names himself the Night and oftener Death,

And wears a helmet mounted with a skull,

And bears a skeleton figured on his arms,

To show that who may slay or scape the three,

Slain by himself, shall enter endless night.

And all these four be fools, but mighty men,

And therefore am I come for Lancelot.'


Hereat Sir Gareth called from where he rose,

A head with kindling eyes above the throng,

'A boon, Sir King--this quest!' then--for he marked

Kay near him groaning like a wounded bull--

'Yea, King, thou knowest thy kitchen-knave am I,

And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I,

And I can topple over a hundred such.

Thy promise, King,' and Arthur glancing at him,

Brought down a momentary brow.  'Rough, sudden,

And pardonable, worthy to be knight--

Go therefore,' and all hearers were amazed.


But on the damsel's forehead shame, pride, wrath

Slew the May-white:  she lifted either arm,

'Fie on thee, King! I asked for thy chief knight,

And thou hast given me but a kitchen-knave.'

Then ere a man in hall could stay her, turned,

Fled down the lane of access to the King,

Took horse, descended the slope street, and past

The weird white gate, and paused without, beside

The field of tourney, murmuring 'kitchen-knave.'


Now two great entries opened from the hall,

At one end one, that gave upon a range

Of level pavement where the King would pace

At sunrise, gazing over plain and wood;

And down from this a lordly stairway sloped

Till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers;

And out by this main doorway past the King.

But one was counter to the hearth, and rose

High that the highest-crested helm could ride

Therethrough nor graze:  and by this entry fled

The damsel in her wrath, and on to this

Sir Gareth strode, and saw without the door

King Arthur's gift, the worth of half a town,

A warhorse of the best, and near it stood

The two that out of north had followed him:

This bare a maiden shield, a casque; that held

The horse, the spear; whereat Sir Gareth loosed

A cloak that dropt from collar-bone to heel,

A cloth of roughest web, and cast it down,

And from it like a fuel-smothered fire,

That lookt half-dead, brake bright, and flashed as those

Dull-coated things, that making slide apart

Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns

A jewelled harness, ere they pass and fly.

So Gareth ere he parted flashed in arms.

Then as he donned the helm, and took the shield

And mounted horse and graspt a spear, of grain

Storm-strengthened on a windy site, and tipt

With trenchant steel, around him slowly prest

The people, while from out of kitchen came

The thralls in throng, and seeing who had worked

Lustier than any, and whom they could but love,

Mounted in arms, threw up their caps and cried,

'God bless the King, and all his fellowship!'

And on through lanes of shouting Gareth rode

Down the slope street, and past without the gate.


So Gareth past with joy; but as the cur

Pluckt from the cur he fights with, ere his cause

Be cooled by fighting, follows, being named,

His owner, but remembers all, and growls

Remembering, so Sir Kay beside the door

Muttered in scorn of Gareth whom he used

To harry and hustle.


                   'Bound upon a quest

With horse and arms--the King hath past his time--

My scullion knave!  Thralls to your work again,

For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!

Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?

Begone!--my knave!--belike and like enow

Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth

So shook his wits they wander in his prime--

Crazed!  How the villain lifted up his voice,

Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.

Tut:  he was tame and meek enow with me,

Till peacocked up with Lancelot's noticing.

Well--I will after my loud knave, and learn

Whether he know me for his master yet.

Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance

Hold, by God's grace, he shall into the mire--

Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,

Into the smoke again.'


                     But Lancelot said,

'Kay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King,

For that did never he whereon ye rail,

But ever meekly served the King in thee?

Abide:  take counsel; for this lad is great

And lusty, and knowing both of lance and sword.'

'Tut, tell not me,' said Kay, 'ye are overfine

To mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies:'

Then mounted, on through silent faces rode

Down the slope city, and out beyond the gate.


But by the field of tourney lingering yet

Muttered the damsel, 'Wherefore did the King

Scorn me? for, were Sir Lancelot lackt, at least

He might have yielded to me one of those

Who tilt for lady's love and glory here,

Rather than--O sweet heaven!  O fie upon him--

His kitchen-knave.'


                  To whom Sir Gareth drew

(And there were none but few goodlier than he)

Shining in arms, 'Damsel, the quest is mine.

Lead, and I follow.'  She thereat, as one

That smells a foul-fleshed agaric in the holt,

And deems it carrion of some woodland thing,

Or shrew, or weasel, nipt her slender nose

With petulant thumb and finger, shrilling, 'Hence!

Avoid, thou smellest all of kitchen-grease.

And look who comes behind,' for there was Kay.

'Knowest thou not me? thy master? I am Kay.

We lack thee by the hearth.'


                           And Gareth to him,

'Master no more! too well I know thee, ay--

The most ungentle knight in Arthur's hall.'

'Have at thee then,' said Kay:  they shocked, and Kay

Fell shoulder-slipt, and Gareth cried again,

'Lead, and I follow,' and fast away she fled.


But after sod and shingle ceased to fly

Behind her, and the heart of her good horse

Was nigh to burst with violence of the beat,

Perforce she stayed, and overtaken spoke.


'What doest thou, scullion, in my fellowship?

Deem'st thou that I accept thee aught the more

Or love thee better, that by some device

Full cowardly, or by mere unhappiness,

Thou hast overthrown and slain thy master--thou!--

Dish-washer and broach-turner, loon!--to me

Thou smellest all of kitchen as before.'


'Damsel,' Sir Gareth answered gently, 'say

Whate'er ye will, but whatsoe'er ye say,

I leave not till I finish this fair quest,

Or die therefore.'


                 'Ay, wilt thou finish it?

Sweet lord, how like a noble knight he talks!

The listening rogue hath caught the manner of it.

But, knave, anon thou shalt be met with, knave,

And then by such a one that thou for all

The kitchen brewis that was ever supt

Shalt not once dare to look him in the face.'


'I shall assay,' said Gareth with a smile

That maddened her, and away she flashed again

Down the long avenues of a boundless wood,

And Gareth following was again beknaved.


'Sir Kitchen-knave, I have missed the only way

Where Arthur's men are set along the wood;

The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves:

If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet,

Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine?

Fight, an thou canst:  I have missed the only way.'


So till the dusk that followed evensong

Rode on the two, reviler and reviled;

Then after one long slope was mounted, saw,

Bowl-shaped, through tops of many thousand pines

A gloomy-gladed hollow slowly sink

To westward--in the deeps whereof a mere,

Round as the red eye of an Eagle-owl,

Under the half-dead sunset glared; and shouts

Ascended, and there brake a servingman

Flying from out of the black wood, and crying,

'They have bound my lord to cast him in the mere.'

Then Gareth, 'Bound am I to right the wronged,

But straitlier bound am I to bide with thee.'

And when the damsel spake contemptuously,

'Lead, and I follow,' Gareth cried again,

'Follow, I lead!' so down among the pines

He plunged; and there, blackshadowed nigh the mere,

And mid-thigh-deep in bulrushes and reed,

Saw six tall men haling a seventh along,

A stone about his neck to drown him in it.

Three with good blows he quieted, but three

Fled through the pines; and Gareth loosed the stone

From off his neck, then in the mere beside

Tumbled it; oilily bubbled up the mere.

Last, Gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet

Set him, a stalwart Baron, Arthur's friend.


'Well that ye came, or else these caitiff rogues

Had wreaked themselves on me; good cause is theirs

To hate me, for my wont hath ever been

To catch my thief, and then like vermin here

Drown him, and with a stone about his neck;

And under this wan water many of them

Lie rotting, but at night let go the stone,

And rise, and flickering in a grimly light

Dance on the mere.  Good now, ye have saved a life

Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood.

And fain would I reward thee worshipfully.

What guerdon will ye?'

                     Gareth sharply spake,

'None! for the deed's sake have I done the deed,

In uttermost obedience to the King.

But wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage?'


Whereat the Baron saying, 'I well believe

You be of Arthur's Table,' a light laugh

Broke from Lynette, 'Ay, truly of a truth,

And in a sort, being Arthur's kitchen-knave!--

But deem not I accept thee aught the more,

Scullion, for running sharply with thy spit

Down on a rout of craven foresters.

A thresher with his flail had scattered them.

Nay--for thou smellest of the kitchen still.

But an this lord will yield us harbourage,

Well.'


     So she spake.  A league beyond the wood,

All in a full-fair manor and a rich,

His towers where that day a feast had been

Held in high hall, and many a viand left,

And many a costly cate, received the three.

And there they placed a peacock in his pride

Before the damsel, and the Baron set

Gareth beside her, but at once she rose.


'Meseems, that here is much discourtesy,

Setting this knave, Lord Baron, at my side.

Hear me--this morn I stood in Arthur's hall,

And prayed the King would grant me Lancelot

To fight the brotherhood of Day and Night--

The last a monster unsubduable

Of any save of him for whom I called--

Suddenly bawls this frontless kitchen-knave,

"The quest is mine; thy kitchen-knave am I,

And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I."

Then Arthur all at once gone mad replies,

"Go therefore," and so gives the quest to him--

Him--here--a villain fitter to stick swine

Than ride abroad redressing women's wrong,

Or sit beside a noble gentlewoman.'


Then half-ashamed and part-amazed, the lord

Now looked at one and now at other, left

The damsel by the peacock in his pride,

And, seating Gareth at another board,

Sat down beside him, ate and then began.


'Friend, whether thou be kitchen-knave, or not,

Or whether it be the maiden's fantasy,

And whether she be mad, or else the King,

Or both or neither, or thyself be mad,

I ask not:  but thou strikest a strong stroke,

For strong thou art and goodly therewithal,

And saver of my life; and therefore now,

For here be mighty men to joust with, weigh

Whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back

To crave again Sir Lancelot of the King.

Thy pardon; I but speak for thine avail,

The saver of my life.'


                     And Gareth said,

'Full pardon, but I follow up the quest,

Despite of Day and Night and Death and Hell.'


So when, next morn, the lord whose life he saved

Had, some brief space, conveyed them on their way

And left them with God-speed, Sir Gareth spake,

'Lead, and I follow.'  Haughtily she replied.


'I fly no more:  I allow thee for an hour.

Lion and stout have isled together, knave,

In time of flood.  Nay, furthermore, methinks

Some ruth is mine for thee.  Back wilt thou, fool?

For hard by here is one will overthrow

And slay thee:  then will I to court again,

And shame the King for only yielding me

My champion from the ashes of his hearth.'


To whom Sir Gareth answered courteously,

'Say thou thy say, and I will do my deed.

Allow me for mine hour, and thou wilt find

My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay

Among the ashes and wedded the King's son.'


Then to the shore of one of those long loops

Wherethrough the serpent river coiled, they came.

Rough-thicketed were the banks and steep; the stream

Full, narrow; this a bridge of single arc

Took at a leap; and on the further side

Arose a silk pavilion, gay with gold

In streaks and rays, and all Lent-lily in hue,

Save that the dome was purple, and above,

Crimson, a slender banneret fluttering.

And therebefore the lawless warrior paced

Unarmed, and calling, 'Damsel, is this he,

The champion thou hast brought from Arthur's hall?

For whom we let thee pass.'  'Nay, nay,' she said,

'Sir Morning-Star.  The King in utter scorn

Of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here

His kitchen-knave:  and look thou to thyself:

See that he fall not on thee suddenly,

And slay thee unarmed:  he is not knight but knave.'


Then at his call, 'O daughters of the Dawn,

And servants of the Morning-Star, approach,

Arm me,' from out the silken curtain-folds

Bare-footed and bare-headed three fair girls

In gilt and rosy raiment came:  their feet

In dewy grasses glistened; and the hair

All over glanced with dewdrop or with gem

Like sparkles in the stone Avanturine.

These armed him in blue arms, and gave a shield

Blue also, and thereon the morning star.

And Gareth silent gazed upon the knight,

Who stood a moment, ere his horse was brought,

Glorying; and in the stream beneath him, shone

Immingled with Heaven's azure waveringly,

The gay pavilion and the naked feet,

His arms, the rosy raiment, and the star.


Then she that watched him, 'Wherefore stare ye so?

Thou shakest in thy fear:  there yet is time:

Flee down the valley before he get to horse.

Who will cry shame?  Thou art not knight but knave.'


Said Gareth, 'Damsel, whether knave or knight,

Far liefer had I fight a score of times

Than hear thee so missay me and revile.

Fair words were best for him who fights for thee;

But truly foul are better, for they send

That strength of anger through mine arms, I know

That I shall overthrow him.'


                           And he that bore

The star, when mounted, cried from o'er the bridge,

'A kitchen-knave, and sent in scorn of me!

Such fight not I, but answer scorn with scorn.

For this were shame to do him further wrong

Than set him on his feet, and take his horse

And arms, and so return him to the King.

Come, therefore, leave thy lady lightly, knave.

Avoid:  for it beseemeth not a knave

To ride with such a lady.'


                         'Dog, thou liest.

I spring from loftier lineage than thine own.'

He spake; and all at fiery speed the two

Shocked on the central bridge, and either spear

Bent but not brake, and either knight at once,

Hurled as a stone from out of a catapult

Beyond his horse's crupper and the bridge,

Fell, as if dead; but quickly rose and drew,

And Gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand

He drave his enemy backward down the bridge,

The damsel crying, 'Well-stricken, kitchen-knave!'

Till Gareth's shield was cloven; but one stroke

Laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground.


Then cried the fallen, 'Take not my life:  I yield.'

And Gareth, 'So this damsel ask it of me

Good--I accord it easily as a grace.'

She reddening, 'Insolent scullion:  I of thee?

I bound to thee for any favour asked!'

'Then he shall die.'  And Gareth there unlaced

His helmet as to slay him, but she shrieked,

'Be not so hardy, scullion, as to slay

One nobler than thyself.'  'Damsel, thy charge

Is an abounding pleasure to me.  Knight,

Thy life is thine at her command.  Arise

And quickly pass to Arthur's hall, and say

His kitchen-knave hath sent thee.  See thou crave

His pardon for thy breaking of his laws.

Myself, when I return, will plead for thee.

Thy shield is mine--farewell; and, damsel, thou,

Lead, and I follow.'


                   And fast away she fled.

Then when he came upon her, spake, 'Methought,

Knave, when I watched thee striking on the bridge

The savour of thy kitchen came upon me

A little faintlier:  but the wind hath changed:

I scent it twenty-fold.'  And then she sang,

'"O morning star" (not that tall felon there

Whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness

Or some device, hast foully overthrown),

"O morning star that smilest in the blue,

O star, my morning dream hath proven true,

Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me."


'But thou begone, take counsel, and away,

For hard by here is one that guards a ford--

The second brother in their fool's parable--

Will pay thee all thy wages, and to boot.

Care not for shame:  thou art not knight but knave.'


To whom Sir Gareth answered, laughingly,

'Parables?  Hear a parable of the knave.

When I was kitchen-knave among the rest

Fierce was the hearth, and one of my co-mates

Owned a rough dog, to whom he cast his coat,

"Guard it," and there was none to meddle with it.

And such a coat art thou, and thee the King

Gave me to guard, and such a dog am I,

To worry, and not to flee--and--knight or knave--

The knave that doth thee service as full knight

Is all as good, meseems, as any knight

Toward thy sister's freeing.'


                            'Ay, Sir Knave!

Ay, knave, because thou strikest as a knight,

Being but knave, I hate thee all the more.'


'Fair damsel, you should worship me the more,

That, being but knave, I throw thine enemies.'


'Ay, ay,' she said, 'but thou shalt meet thy match.'


So when they touched the second river-loop,

Huge on a huge red horse, and all in mail

Burnished to blinding, shone the Noonday Sun

Beyond a raging shallow.  As if the flower,

That blows a globe of after arrowlets,

Ten thousand-fold had grown, flashed the fierce shield,

All sun; and Gareth's eyes had flying blots

Before them when he turned from watching him.

He from beyond the roaring shallow roared,

'What doest thou, brother, in my marches here?'

And she athwart the shallow shrilled again,

'Here is a kitchen-knave from Arthur's hall

Hath overthrown thy brother, and hath his arms.'

'Ugh!' cried the Sun, and vizoring up a red

And cipher face of rounded foolishness,

Pushed horse across the foamings of the ford,

Whom Gareth met midstream:  no room was there

For lance or tourney-skill:  four strokes they struck

With sword, and these were mighty; the new knight

Had fear he might be shamed; but as the Sun

Heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth,

The hoof of his horse slipt in the stream, the stream

Descended, and the Sun was washed away.


Then Gareth laid his lance athwart the ford;

So drew him home; but he that fought no more,

As being all bone-battered on the rock,

Yielded; and Gareth sent him to the King,

'Myself when I return will plead for thee.'

'Lead, and I follow.'  Quietly she led.

'Hath not the good wind, damsel, changed again?'

'Nay, not a point:  nor art thou victor here.

There lies a ridge of slate across the ford;

His horse thereon stumbled--ay, for I saw it.


'"O Sun" (not this strong fool whom thou, Sir Knave,

Hast overthrown through mere unhappiness),

"O Sun, that wakenest all to bliss or pain,

O moon, that layest all to sleep again,

Shine sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."


What knowest thou of lovesong or of love?

Nay, nay, God wot, so thou wert nobly born,

Thou hast a pleasant presence.  Yea, perchance,--


'"O dewy flowers that open to the sun,

O dewy flowers that close when day is done,

Blow sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."


'What knowest thou of flowers, except, belike,

To garnish meats with? hath not our good King

Who lent me thee, the flower of kitchendom,

A foolish love for flowers? what stick ye round

The pasty? wherewithal deck the boar's head?

Flowers? nay, the boar hath rosemaries and bay.


'"O birds, that warble to the morning sky,

O birds that warble as the day goes by,

Sing sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."


'What knowest thou of birds, lark, mavis, merle,

Linnet? what dream ye when they utter forth

May-music growing with the growing light,

Their sweet sun-worship? these be for the snare

(So runs thy fancy) these be for the spit,

Larding and basting.  See thou have not now

Larded thy last, except thou turn and fly.

There stands the third fool of their allegory.'


For there beyond a bridge of treble bow,

All in a rose-red from the west, and all

Naked it seemed, and glowing in the broad

Deep-dimpled current underneath, the knight,

That named himself the Star of Evening, stood.


And Gareth, 'Wherefore waits the madman there

Naked in open dayshine?'  'Nay,' she cried,

'Not naked, only wrapt in hardened skins

That fit him like his own; and so ye cleave

His armour off him, these will turn the blade.'


Then the third brother shouted o'er the bridge,

'O brother-star, why shine ye here so low?

Thy ward is higher up:  but have ye slain

The damsel's champion?' and the damsel cried,


'No star of thine, but shot from Arthur's heaven

With all disaster unto thine and thee!

For both thy younger brethren have gone down

Before this youth; and so wilt thou, Sir Star;

Art thou not old?'

                 'Old, damsel, old and hard,

Old, with the might and breath of twenty boys.'

Said Gareth, 'Old, and over-bold in brag!

But that same strength which threw the Morning Star

Can throw the Evening.'


                      Then that other blew

A hard and deadly note upon the horn.

'Approach and arm me!'  With slow steps from out

An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained

Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,

And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm

With but a drying evergreen for crest,

And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even

Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone.

But when it glittered o'er the saddle-bow,

They madly hurled together on the bridge;

And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,

There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,

But up like fire he started:  and as oft

As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,

So many a time he vaulted up again;

Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,

Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,

Laboured within him, for he seemed as one

That all in later, sadder age begins

To war against ill uses of a life,

But these from all his life arise, and cry,

'Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!'

He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike

Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,

'Well done, knave-knight, well-stricken, O good knight-knave--

O knave, as noble as any of all the knights--

Shame me not, shame me not.  I have prophesied--

Strike, thou art worthy of the Table Round--

His arms are old, he trusts the hardened skin--

Strike--strike--the wind will never change again.'

And Gareth hearing ever stronglier smote,

And hewed great pieces of his armour off him,

But lashed in vain against the hardened skin,

And could not wholly bring him under, more

Than loud Southwesterns, rolling ridge on ridge,

The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs

For ever; till at length Sir Gareth's brand

Clashed his, and brake it utterly to the hilt.

'I have thee now;' but forth that other sprang,

And, all unknightlike, writhed his wiry arms

Around him, till he felt, despite his mail,

Strangled, but straining even his uttermost

Cast, and so hurled him headlong o'er the bridge

Down to the river, sink or swim, and cried,

'Lead, and I follow.'


                    But the damsel said,

'I lead no longer; ride thou at my side;

Thou art the kingliest of all kitchen-knaves.


'"O trefoil, sparkling on the rainy plain,

O rainbow with three colours after rain,

Shine sweetly:  thrice my love hath smiled on me."


'Sir,--and, good faith, I fain had added--Knight,

But that I heard thee call thyself a knave,--

Shamed am I that I so rebuked, reviled,

Missaid thee; noble I am; and thought the King

Scorned me and mine; and now thy pardon, friend,

For thou hast ever answered courteously,

And wholly bold thou art, and meek withal

As any of Arthur's best, but, being knave,

Hast mazed my wit:  I marvel what thou art.'


'Damsel,' he said, 'you be not all to blame,

Saving that you mistrusted our good King

Would handle scorn, or yield you, asking, one

Not fit to cope your quest.  You said your say;

Mine answer was my deed.  Good sooth!  I hold

He scarce is knight, yea but half-man, nor meet

To fight for gentle damsel, he, who lets

His heart be stirred with any foolish heat

At any gentle damsel's waywardness.

Shamed? care not! thy foul sayings fought for me:

And seeing now thy words are fair, methinks

There rides no knight, not Lancelot, his great self,

Hath force to quell me.'

                       Nigh upon that hour

When the lone hern forgets his melancholy,

Lets down his other leg, and stretching, dreams

Of goodly supper in the distant pool,

Then turned the noble damsel smiling at him,

And told him of a cavern hard at hand,

Where bread and baken meats and good red wine

Of Southland, which the Lady Lyonors

Had sent her coming champion, waited him.


Anon they past a narrow comb wherein

Where slabs of rock with figures, knights on horse

Sculptured, and deckt in slowly-waning hues.

'Sir Knave, my knight, a hermit once was here,

Whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock

The war of Time against the soul of man.

And yon four fools have sucked their allegory

From these damp walls, and taken but the form.

Know ye not these?' and Gareth lookt and read--

In letters like to those the vexillary

Hath left crag-carven o'er the streaming Gelt--

'PHOSPHORUS,' then 'MERIDIES'--'HESPERUS'--

'NOX'--'MORS,' beneath five figures, arm'd men,

Slab after slab, their faces forward all,

And running down the Soul, a Shape that fled

With broken wings, torn raiment and loose hair,

For help and shelter to the hermit's cave.

'Follow the faces, and we find it.  Look,

Who comes behind?'


                 For one--delayed at first

Through helping back the dislocated Kay

To Camelot, then by what thereafter chanced,

The damsel's headlong error through the wood--

Sir Lancelot, having swum the river-loops--

His blue shield-lions covered--softly drew

Behind the twain, and when he saw the star

Gleam, on Sir Gareth's turning to him, cried,

'Stay, felon knight, I avenge me for my friend.'

And Gareth crying pricked against the cry;

But when they closed--in a moment--at one touch

Of that skilled spear, the wonder of the world--

Went sliding down so easily, and fell,

That when he found the grass within his hands

He laughed; the laughter jarred upon Lynette:

Harshly she asked him, 'Shamed and overthrown,

And tumbled back into the kitchen-knave,

Why laugh ye? that ye blew your boast in vain?'

'Nay, noble damsel, but that I, the son

Of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,

And victor of the bridges and the ford,

And knight of Arthur, here lie thrown by whom

I know not, all through mere unhappiness--

Device and sorcery and unhappiness--

Out, sword; we are thrown!'  And Lancelot answered, 'Prince,

O Gareth--through the mere unhappiness

Of one who came to help thee, not to harm,

Lancelot, and all as glad to find thee whole,

As on the day when Arthur knighted him.'


Then Gareth, 'Thou--Lancelot!--thine the hand

That threw me?  An some chance to mar the boast

Thy brethren of thee make--which could not chance--

Had sent thee down before a lesser spear,

Shamed had I been, and sad--O Lancelot--thou!'


Whereat the maiden, petulant, 'Lancelot,

Why came ye not, when called? and wherefore now

Come ye, not called?  I gloried in my knave,

Who being still rebuked, would answer still

Courteous as any knight--but now, if knight,

The marvel dies, and leaves me fooled and tricked,

And only wondering wherefore played upon:

And doubtful whether I and mine be scorned.

Where should be truth if not in Arthur's hall,

In Arthur's presence?  Knight, knave, prince and fool,

I hate thee and for ever.'


                         And Lancelot said,

'Bless'd be thou, Sir Gareth! knight art thou

To the King's best wish.  O damsel, be you wise

To call him shamed, who is but overthrown?

Thrown have I been, nor once, but many a time.

Victor from vanquished issues at the last,

And overthrower from being overthrown.

With sword we have not striven; and thy good horse

And thou are weary; yet not less I felt

Thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine.

Well hast thou done; for all the stream is freed,

And thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes,

And when reviled, hast answered graciously,

And makest merry when overthrown.  Prince, Knight

Hail, Knight and Prince, and of our Table Round!'


And then when turning to Lynette he told

The tale of Gareth, petulantly she said,

'Ay well--ay well--for worse than being fooled

Of others, is to fool one's self.  A cave,

Sir Lancelot, is hard by, with meats and drinks

And forage for the horse, and flint for fire.

But all about it flies a honeysuckle.

Seek, till we find.'  And when they sought and found,

Sir Gareth drank and ate, and all his life

Past into sleep; on whom the maiden gazed.

'Sound sleep be thine! sound cause to sleep hast thou.

Wake lusty!  Seem I not as tender to him

As any mother?  Ay, but such a one

As all day long hath rated at her child,

And vext his day, but blesses him asleep--

Good lord, how sweetly smells the honeysuckle

In the hushed night, as if the world were one

Of utter peace, and love, and gentleness!

O Lancelot, Lancelot'--and she clapt her hands--

'Full merry am I to find my goodly knave

Is knight and noble.  See now, sworn have I,

Else yon black felon had not let me pass,

To bring thee back to do the battle with him.

Thus an thou goest, he will fight thee first;

Who doubts thee victor? so will my knight-knave

Miss the full flower of this accomplishment.'


Said Lancelot, 'Peradventure he, you name,

May know my shield.  Let Gareth, an he will,

Change his for mine, and take my charger, fresh,

Not to be spurred, loving the battle as well

As he that rides him.'  'Lancelot-like,' she said,

'Courteous in this, Lord Lancelot, as in all.'


And Gareth, wakening, fiercely clutched the shield;

'Ramp ye lance-splintering lions, on whom all spears

Are rotten sticks! ye seem agape to roar!

Yea, ramp and roar at leaving of your lord!--

Care not, good beasts, so well I care for you.

O noble Lancelot, from my hold on these

Streams virtue--fire--through one that will not shame

Even the shadow of Lancelot under shield.

Hence:  let us go.'


                 Silent the silent field

They traversed.  Arthur's harp though summer-wan,

In counter motion to the clouds, allured

The glance of Gareth dreaming on his liege.

A star shot:  'Lo,' said Gareth, 'the foe falls!'

An owl whoopt:  'Hark the victor pealing there!'

Suddenly she that rode upon his left

Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying,

'Yield, yield him this again:  'tis he must fight:

I curse the tongue that all through yesterday

Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now

To lend thee horse and shield:  wonders ye have done;

Miracles ye cannot:  here is glory enow

In having flung the three:  I see thee maimed,

Mangled:  I swear thou canst not fling the fourth.'


'And wherefore, damsel? tell me all ye know.

You cannot scare me; nor rough face, or voice,

Brute bulk of limb, or boundless savagery

Appal me from the quest.'


                        'Nay, Prince,' she cried,

'God wot, I never looked upon the face,

Seeing he never rides abroad by day;

But watched him have I like a phantom pass

Chilling the night:  nor have I heard the voice.

Always he made his mouthpiece of a page

Who came and went, and still reported him

As closing in himself the strength of ten,

And when his anger tare him, massacring

Man, woman, lad and girl--yea, the soft babe!

Some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh,

Monster!  O Prince, I went for Lancelot first,

The quest is Lancelot's:  give him back the shield.'


Said Gareth laughing, 'An he fight for this,

Belike he wins it as the better man:

Thus--and not else!'


                   But Lancelot on him urged

All the devisings of their chivalry

When one might meet a mightier than himself;

How best to manage horse, lance, sword and shield,

And so fill up the gap where force might fail

With skill and fineness.  Instant were his words.


Then Gareth, 'Here be rules.  I know but one--

To dash against mine enemy and win.

Yet have I seen thee victor in the joust,

And seen thy way.'  'Heaven help thee,' sighed Lynette.


Then for a space, and under cloud that grew

To thunder-gloom palling all stars, they rode

In converse till she made her palfrey halt,

Lifted an arm, and softly whispered, 'There.'

And all the three were silent seeing, pitched

Beside the Castle Perilous on flat field,

A huge pavilion like a mountain peak

Sunder the glooming crimson on the marge,

Black, with black banner, and a long black horn

Beside it hanging; which Sir Gareth graspt,

And so, before the two could hinder him,

Sent all his heart and breath through all the horn.

Echoed the walls; a light twinkled; anon

Came lights and lights, and once again he blew;

Whereon were hollow tramplings up and down

And muffled voices heard, and shadows past;

Till high above him, circled with her maids,

The Lady Lyonors at a window stood,

Beautiful among lights, and waving to him

White hands, and courtesy; but when the Prince

Three times had blown--after long hush--at last--

The huge pavilion slowly yielded up,

Through those black foldings, that which housed therein.

High on a nightblack horse, in nightblack arms,

With white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,

And crowned with fleshless laughter--some ten steps--

In the half-light--through the dim dawn--advanced

The monster, and then paused, and spake no word.


But Gareth spake and all indignantly,

'Fool, for thou hast, men say, the strength of ten,

Canst thou not trust the limbs thy God hath given,

But must, to make the terror of thee more,

Trick thyself out in ghastly imageries

Of that which Life hath done with, and the clod,

Less dull than thou, will hide with mantling flowers

As if for pity?'  But he spake no word;

Which set the horror higher:  a maiden swooned;

The Lady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept,

As doomed to be the bride of Night and Death;

Sir Gareth's head prickled beneath his helm;

And even Sir Lancelot through his warm blood felt

Ice strike, and all that marked him were aghast.


At once Sir Lancelot's charger fiercely neighed,

And Death's dark war-horse bounded forward with him.

Then those that did not blink the terror, saw

That Death was cast to ground, and slowly rose.

But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull.

Half fell to right and half to left and lay.

Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm

As throughly as the skull; and out from this

Issued the bright face of a blooming boy

Fresh as a flower new-born, and crying, 'Knight,

Slay me not:  my three brethren bad me do it,

To make a horror all about the house,

And stay the world from Lady Lyonors.

They never dreamed the passes would be past.'

Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one

Not many a moon his younger, 'My fair child,

What madness made thee challenge the chief knight

Of Arthur's hall?'  'Fair Sir, they bad me do it.

They hate the King, and Lancelot, the King's friend,

They hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream,

They never dreamed the passes could be past.'


Then sprang the happier day from underground;

And Lady Lyonors and her house, with dance

And revel and song, made merry over Death,

As being after all their foolish fears

And horrors only proven a blooming boy.

So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest.


And he that told the tale in older times

Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors,

But he, that told it later, says Lynette.

Poem 32: Geraint And Enid

O purblind race of miserable men,

How many among us at this very hour

Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,

By taking true for false, or false for true;

Here, through the feeble twilight of this world

Groping, how many, until we pass and reach

That other, where we see as we are seen!


So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth

That morning, when they both had got to horse,

Perhaps because he loved her passionately,

And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,

Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce

Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:

'Not at my side.  I charge thee ride before,

Ever a good way on before; and this

I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,

Whatever happens, not to speak to me,

No, not a word!' and Enid was aghast;

And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,

When crying out, 'Effeminate as I am,

I will not fight my way with gilded arms,

All shall be iron;' he loosed a mighty purse,

Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.

So the last sight that Enid had of home

Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown

With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire

Chafing his shoulder:  then he cried again,

'To the wilds!' and Enid leading down the tracks

Through which he bad her lead him on, they past

The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,

Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,

And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:

Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:

A stranger meeting them had surely thought

They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,

That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.

For he was ever saying to himself,

'O I that wasted time to tend upon her,

To compass her with sweet observances,

To dress her beautifully and keep her true'--

And there he broke the sentence in his heart

Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue

May break it, when his passion masters him.

And she was ever praying the sweet heavens

To save her dear lord whole from any wound.

And ever in her mind she cast about

For that unnoticed failing in herself,

Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;

Till the great plover's human whistle amazed

Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared

In ever wavering brake an ambuscade.

Then thought again, 'If there be such in me,

I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,

If he would only speak and tell me of it.'


But when the fourth part of the day was gone,

Then Enid was aware of three tall knights

On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock

In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;

And heard one crying to his fellow, 'Look,

Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,

Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;

Come, we will slay him and will have his horse

And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.'


Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:

'I will go back a little to my lord,

And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;

For, be he wroth even to slaying me,

Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,

Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.'


Then she went back some paces of return,

Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;

'My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock

Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast

That they would slay you, and possess your horse

And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.'


He made a wrathful answer:  'Did I wish

Your warning or your silence? one command

I laid upon you, not to speak to me,

And thus ye keep it!  Well then, look--for now,

Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,

Long for my life, or hunger for my death,

Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.'


Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,

And down upon him bare the bandit three.

And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint

Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast

And out beyond; and then against his brace

Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him

A lance that splintered like an icicle,

Swung from his brand a windy buffet out

Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain

Or slew them, and dismounting like a man

That skins the wild beast after slaying him,

Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born

The three gay suits of armour which they wore,

And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits

Of armour on their horses, each on each,

And tied the bridle-reins of all the three

Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on

Before you;' and she drove them through the waste.


He followed nearer; ruth began to work

Against his anger in him, while he watched

The being he loved best in all the world,

With difficulty in mild obedience

Driving them on:  he fain had spoken to her,

And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath

And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;

But evermore it seemed an easier thing

At once without remorse to strike her dead,

Than to cry 'Halt,' and to her own bright face

Accuse her of the least immodesty:

And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more

That she COULD speak whom his own ear had heard

Call herself false:  and suffering thus he made

Minutes an age:  but in scarce longer time

Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,

Before he turn to fall seaward again,

Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold

In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,

Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,

Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,

Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,

And shook her pulses, crying, 'Look, a prize!

Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,

And all in charge of whom? a girl:  set on.'

'Nay,' said the second, 'yonder comes a knight.'

The third, 'A craven; how he hangs his head.'

The giant answered merrily, 'Yea, but one?

Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.'


And Enid pondered in her heart and said,

'I will abide the coming of my lord,

And I will tell him all their villainy.

My lord is weary with the fight before,

And they will fall upon him unawares.

I needs must disobey him for his good;

How should I dare obey him to his harm?

Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,

I save a life dearer to me than mine.'


And she abode his coming, and said to him

With timid firmness, 'Have I leave to speak?'

He said, 'Ye take it, speaking,' and she spoke.


'There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,

And each of them is wholly armed, and one

Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say

That they will fall upon you while ye pass.'


To which he flung a wrathful answer back:

'And if there were an hundred in the wood,

And every man were larger-limbed than I,

And all at once should sally out upon me,

I swear it would not ruffle me so much

As you that not obey me.  Stand aside,

And if I fall, cleave to the better man.'


And Enid stood aside to wait the event,

Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe

Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.

And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.

Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint's,

A little in the late encounter strained,

Struck through the bulky bandit's corselet home,

And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,

And there lay still; as he that tells the tale

Saw once a great piece of a promontory,

That had a sapling growing on it, slide

From the long shore-cliff's windy walls to the beach,

And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:

So lay the man transfixt.  His craven pair

Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,

When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;

On whom the victor, to confound them more,

Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,

That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,

All through the crash of the near cataract hears

The drumming thunder of the huger fall

At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear

His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,

And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned

Flying, but, overtaken, died the death

Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.


Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance

That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves

Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,

And bound them on their horses, each on each,

And tied the bridle-reins of all the three

Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on

Before you,' and she drove them through the wood.


He followed nearer still:  the pain she had

To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,

Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,

Together, served a little to disedge

The sharpness of that pain about her heart:

And they themselves, like creatures gently born

But into bad hands fallen, and now so long

By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt

Her low firm voice and tender government.


So through the green gloom of the wood they past,

And issuing under open heavens beheld

A little town with towers, upon a rock,

And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased

In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:

And down a rocky pathway from the place

There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand

Bare victual for the mowers:  and Geraint

Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:

Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,

He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,

'Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.'

'Yea, willingly,' replied the youth; 'and thou,

My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,

And only meet for mowers;' then set down

His basket, and dismounting on the sward

They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.

And Enid took a little delicately,

Less having stomach for it than desire

To close with her lord's pleasure; but Geraint

Ate all the mowers' victual unawares,

And when he found all empty, was amazed;

And 'Boy,' said he, 'I have eaten all, but take

A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.'

He, reddening in extremity of delight,

'My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.'

'Ye will be all the wealthier,' cried the Prince.

'I take it as free gift, then,' said the boy,

'Not guerdon; for myself can easily,

While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch

Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;

For these are his, and all the field is his,

And I myself am his; and I will tell him

How great a man thou art:  he loves to know

When men of mark are in his territory:

And he will have thee to his palace here,

And serve thee costlier than with mowers' fare.'


Then said Geraint, 'I wish no better fare:

I never ate with angrier appetite

Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.

And into no Earl's palace will I go.

I know, God knows, too much of palaces!

And if he want me, let him come to me.

But hire us some fair chamber for the night,

And stalling for the horses, and return

With victual for these men, and let us know.'


'Yea, my kind lord,' said the glad youth, and went,

Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,

And up the rocky pathway disappeared,

Leading the horse, and they were left alone.


But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes

Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance

At Enid, where she droopt:  his own false doom,

That shadow of mistrust should never cross

Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;

Then with another humorous ruth remarked

The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,

And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,

And after nodded sleepily in the heat.

But she, remembering her old ruined hall,

And all the windy clamour of the daws

About her hollow turret, plucked the grass

There growing longest by the meadow's edge,

And into many a listless annulet,

Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,

Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned

And told them of a chamber, and they went;

Where, after saying to her, 'If ye will,

Call for the woman of the house,' to which

She answered, 'Thanks, my lord;' the two remained

Apart by all the chamber's width, and mute

As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,

Or two wild men supporters of a shield,

Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance

The one at other, parted by the shield.


On a sudden, many a voice along the street,

And heel against the pavement echoing, burst

Their drowse; and either started while the door,

Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,

And midmost of a rout of roisterers,

Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,

Her suitor in old years before Geraint,

Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.

He moving up with pliant courtliness,

Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,

In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,

Found Enid with the corner of his eye,

And knew her sitting sad and solitary.

Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer

To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously

According to his fashion, bad the host

Call in what men soever were his friends,

And feast with these in honour of their Earl;

'And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.'


And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours

Drank till he jested with all ease, and told

Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,

And made it of two colours; for his talk,

When wine and free companions kindled him,

Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem

Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince

To laughter and his comrades to applause.

Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,

'Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak

To your good damsel there who sits apart,

And seems so lonely?'  'My free leave,' he said;

'Get her to speak:  she doth not speak to me.'

Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,

Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,

Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,

Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:


'Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,

Enid, my early and my only love,

Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild--

What chance is this? how is it I see you here?

Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.

Yet fear me not:  I call mine own self wild,

But keep a touch of sweet civility

Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.

I thought, but that your father came between,

In former days you saw me favourably.

And if it were so do not keep it back:

Make me a little happier:  let me know it:

Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?

Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.

And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,

Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,

You come with no attendance, page or maid,

To serve you--doth he love you as of old?

For, call it lovers' quarrels, yet I know

Though men may bicker with the things they love,

They would not make them laughable in all eyes,

Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,

A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks

Your story, that this man loves you no more.

Your beauty is no beauty to him now:

A common chance--right well I know it--palled--

For I know men:  nor will ye win him back,

For the man's love once gone never returns.

But here is one who loves you as of old;

With more exceeding passion than of old:

Good, speak the word:  my followers ring him round:

He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;

They understand:  nay; I do not mean blood:

Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:

My malice is no deeper than a moat,

No stronger than a wall:  there is the keep;

He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:

Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me

The one true lover whom you ever owned,

I will make use of all the power I have.

O pardon me! the madness of that hour,

When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.'


At this the tender sound of his own voice

And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,

Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,

Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;

And answered with such craft as women use,

Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance

That breaks upon them perilously, and said:


'Earl, if you love me as in former years,

And do not practise on me, come with morn,

And snatch me from him as by violence;

Leave me tonight:  I am weary to the death.'


Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume

Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,

And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.

He moving homeward babbled to his men,

How Enid never loved a man but him,

Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.


But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,

Debating his command of silence given,

And that she now perforce must violate it,

Held commune with herself, and while she held

He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart

To wake him, but hung o'er him, wholly pleased

To find him yet unwounded after fight,

And hear him breathing low and equally.

Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped

The pieces of his armour in one place,

All to be there against a sudden need;

Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled

By that day's grief and travel, evermore

Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then

Went slipping down horrible precipices,

And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;

Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,

With all his rout of random followers,

Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;

Which was the red cock shouting to the light,

As the gray dawn stole o'er the dewy world,

And glimmered on his armour in the room.

And once again she rose to look at it,

But touched it unawares:  jangling, the casque

Fell, and he started up and stared at her.

Then breaking his command of silence given,

She told him all that Earl Limours had said,

Except the passage that he loved her not;

Nor left untold the craft herself had used;

But ended with apology so sweet,

Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed

So justified by that necessity,

That though he thought 'was it for him she wept

In Devon?' he but gave a wrathful groan,

Saying, 'Your sweet faces make good fellows fools

And traitors.  Call the host and bid him bring

Charger and palfrey.'  So she glided out

Among the heavy breathings of the house,

And like a household Spirit at the walls

Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:

Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,

In silence, did him service as a squire;

Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,

'Thy reckoning, friend?' and ere he learnt it, 'Take

Five horses and their armours;' and the host

Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,

'My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!'

'Ye will be all the wealthier,' said the Prince,

And then to Enid, 'Forward! and today

I charge you, Enid, more especially,

What thing soever ye may hear, or see,

Or fancy (though I count it of small use

To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.'


And Enid answered, 'Yea, my lord, I know

Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,

I hear the violent threats you do not hear,

I see the danger which you cannot see:

Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;

Almost beyond me:  yet I would obey.'


'Yea so,' said he, 'do it:  be not too wise;

Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,

Not all mismated with a yawning clown,

But one with arms to guard his head and yours,

With eyes to find you out however far,

And ears to hear you even in his dreams.'


With that he turned and looked as keenly at her

As careful robins eye the delver's toil;

And that within her, which a wanton fool,

Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,

Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.

And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.


Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,

Led from the territory of false Limours

To the waste earldom of another earl,

Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,

Went Enid with her sullen follower on.

Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride

More near by many a rood than yestermorn,

It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint

Waving an angry hand as who should say

'Ye watch me,' saddened all her heart again.

But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,

The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof

Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw

Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.

Then not to disobey her lord's behest,

And yet to give him warning, for he rode

As if he heard not, moving back she held

Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.

At which the warrior in his obstinacy,

Because she kept the letter of his word,

Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.

And in the moment after, wild Limours,

Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud

Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,

Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,

And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,

Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore

Down by the length of lance and arm beyond

The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,

And overthrew the next that followed him,

And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.

But at the flash and motion of the man

They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal

Of darting fish, that on a summer morn

Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot

Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand,

But if a man who stands upon the brink

But lift a shining hand against the sun,

There is not left the twinkle of a fin

Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;

So, scared but at the motion of the man,

Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,

And left him lying in the public way;

So vanish friendships only made in wine.


Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,

Who saw the chargers of the two that fell

Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,

Mixt with the flyers.  'Horse and man,' he said,

'All of one mind and all right-honest friends!

Not a hoof left:  and I methinks till now

Was honest--paid with horses and with arms;

I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:

And so what say ye, shall we strip him there

Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough

To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?

No?--then do thou, being right honest, pray

That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,

I too would still be honest.'  Thus he said:

And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,

And answering not one word, she led the way.


But as a man to whom a dreadful loss

Falls in a far land and he knows it not,

But coming back he learns it, and the loss

So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;

So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked

In combat with the follower of Limours,

Bled underneath his armour secretly,

And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife

What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,

Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;

And at a sudden swerving of the road,

Though happily down on a bank of grass,

The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.


And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,

Suddenly came, and at his side all pale

Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,

Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye

Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,

And tearing off her veil of faded silk

Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,

And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord's life.

Then after all was done that hand could do,

She rested, and her desolation came

Upon her, and she wept beside the way.


And many past, but none regarded her,

For in that realm of lawless turbulence,

A woman weeping for her murdered mate

Was cared as much for as a summer shower:

One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,

Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:

Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,

Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;

Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,

He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:

Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm

Before an ever-fancied arrow, made

The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;

At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,

And scoured into the coppices and was lost,

While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.


But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,

Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,

Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,

Came riding with a hundred lances up;

But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,

Cried out with a big voice, 'What, is he dead?'

'No, no, not dead!' she answered in all haste.

'Would some of your people take him up,

And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?

Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.'


Then said Earl Doorm:  'Well, if he be not dead,

Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.

And be he dead, I count you for a fool;

Your wailing will not quicken him:  dead or not,

Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.

Yet, since the face IS comely--some of you,

Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:

An if he live, we will have him of our band;

And if he die, why earth has earth enough

To hide him.  See ye take the charger too,

A noble one.'

            He spake, and past away,

But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,

Each growling like a dog, when his good bone

Seems to be plucked at by the village boys

Who love to vex him eating, and he fears

To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,

Gnawing and growling:  so the ruffians growled,

Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,

Their chance of booty from the morning's raid,

Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,

Such as they brought upon their forays out

For those that might be wounded; laid him on it

All in the hollow of his shield, and took

And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,

(His gentle charger following him unled)

And cast him and the bier in which he lay

Down on an oaken settle in the hall,

And then departed, hot in haste to join

Their luckier mates, but growling as before,

And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,

And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.

They might as well have blest her:  she was deaf

To blessing or to cursing save from one.


So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,

There in the naked hall, propping his head,

And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.

Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,

And found his own dear bride propping his head,

And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;

And felt the warm tears falling on his face;

And said to his own heart, 'She weeps for me:'

And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,

That he might prove her to the uttermost,

And say to his own heart, 'She weeps for me.'


But in the falling afternoon returned

The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.

His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:

Each hurling down a heap of things that rang

Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,

And doffed his helm:  and then there fluttered in,

Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,

A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,

And mingled with the spearmen:  and Earl Doorm

Struck with a knife's haft hard against the board,

And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.

And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,

And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:

And none spake word, but all sat down at once,

And ate with tumult in the naked hall,

Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;

Till Enid shrank far back into herself,

To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.

But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,

He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found

A damsel drooping in a corner of it.

Then he remembered her, and how she wept;

And out of her there came a power upon him;

And rising on the sudden he said, 'Eat!

I never yet beheld a thing so pale.

God's curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.

Eat!  Look yourself.  Good luck had your good man,

For were I dead who is it would weep for me?

Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath

Have I beheld a lily like yourself.

And so there lived some colour in your cheek,

There is not one among my gentlewomen

Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.

But listen to me, and by me be ruled,

And I will do the thing I have not done,

For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,

And we will live like two birds in one nest,

And I will fetch you forage from all fields,

For I compel all creatures to my will.'


He spoke:  the brawny spearman let his cheek

Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;

While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn

Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf

And makes it earth, hissed each at other's ear

What shall not be recorded--women they,

Women, or what had been those gracious things,

But now desired the humbling of their best,

Yea, would have helped him to it:  and all at once

They hated her, who took no thought of them,

But answered in low voice, her meek head yet

Drooping, 'I pray you of your courtesy,

He being as he is, to let me be.'


She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,

But like a mighty patron, satisfied

With what himself had done so graciously,

Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, 'Yea,

Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.'


She answered meekly, 'How should I be glad

Henceforth in all the world at anything,

Until my lord arise and look upon me?'


Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,

As all but empty heart and weariness

And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,

And bare her by main violence to the board,

And thrust the dish before her, crying, 'Eat.'


'No, no,' said Enid, vext, 'I will not eat

Till yonder man upon the bier arise,

And eat with me.'  'Drink, then,' he answered.  'Here!'

(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)

'Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,

God's curse, with anger--often I myself,

Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:

Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.'


'Not so,' she cried, 'by Heaven, I will not drink

Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,

And drink with me; and if he rise no more,

I will not look at wine until I die.'


At this he turned all red and paced his hall,

Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,

And coming up close to her, said at last:

'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,

Take warning:  yonder man is surely dead;

And I compel all creatures to my will.

Not eat nor drink?  And wherefore wail for one,

Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn

By dressing it in rags?  Amazed am I,

Beholding how ye butt against my wish,

That I forbear you thus:  cross me no more.

At least put off to please me this poor gown,

This silken rag, this beggar-woman's weed:

I love that beauty should go beautifully:

For see ye not my gentlewomen here,

How gay, how suited to the house of one

Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?

Rise therefore; robe yourself in this:  obey.'


He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen

Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,

Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue

Played into green, and thicker down the front

With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,

When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,

And with the dawn ascending lets the day

Strike where it clung:  so thickly shone the gems.


But Enid answered, harder to be moved

Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,

With life-long injuries burning unavenged,

And now their hour has come; and Enid said:


'In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,

And loved me serving in my father's hall:

In this poor gown I rode with him to court,

And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:

In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,

When now we rode upon this fatal quest

Of honour, where no honour can be gained:

And this poor gown I will not cast aside

Until himself arise a living man,

And bid me cast it.  I have griefs enough:

Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:

I never loved, can never love but him:

Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,

He being as he is, to let me be.'


Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,

And took his russet beard between his teeth;

Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood

Crying, 'I count it of no more avail,

Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;

Take my salute,' unknightly with flat hand,

However lightly, smote her on the cheek.


Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,

And since she thought, 'He had not dared to do it,

Except he surely knew my lord was dead,'

Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,

As of a wild thing taken in the trap,

Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.


This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,

(It lay beside him in the hollow shield),

Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it

Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball

The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.

So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.

And all the men and women in the hall

Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled

Yelling as from a spectre, and the two

Were left alone together, and he said:


'Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;

Done you more wrong:  we both have undergone

That trouble which has left me thrice your own:

Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.

And here I lay this penance on myself,

Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn--

You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,

I heard you say, that you were no true wife:

I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:

I do believe yourself against yourself,

And will henceforward rather die than doubt.'


And Enid could not say one tender word,

She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:

She only prayed him, 'Fly, they will return

And slay you; fly, your charger is without,

My palfrey lost.'  'Then, Enid, shall you ride

Behind me.'  'Yea,' said Enid, 'let us go.'

And moving out they found the stately horse,

Who now no more a vassal to the thief,

But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,

Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped

With a low whinny toward the pair:  and she

Kissed the white star upon his noble front,

Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse

Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot

She set her own and climbed; he turned his face

And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms

About him, and at once they rode away.


And never yet, since high in Paradise

O'er the four rivers the first roses blew,

Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind

Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour

Put hand to hand beneath her husband's heart,

And felt him hers again:  she did not weep,

But o'er her meek eyes came a happy mist

Like that which kept the heart of Eden green

Before the useful trouble of the rain:

Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes

As not to see before them on the path,

Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,

A knight of Arthur's court, who laid his lance

In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.

Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,

She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,

Shrieked to the stranger 'Slay not a dead man!'

'The voice of Enid,' said the knight; but she,

Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,

Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,

'O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.'

And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:

'My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;

I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;

And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,

Who love you, Prince, with something of the love

Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.

For once, when I was up so high in pride

That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,

By overthrowing me you threw me higher.

Now, made a knight of Arthur's Table Round,

And since I knew this Earl, when I myself

Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,

I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm

(The King is close behind me) bidding him

Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,

Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.'


'He hears the judgment of the King of kings,'

Cried the wan Prince; 'and lo, the powers of Doorm

Are scattered,' and he pointed to the field,

Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,

Were men and women staring and aghast,

While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told

How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.

But when the knight besought him, 'Follow me,

Prince, to the camp, and in the King's own ear

Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured

Strange chances here alone;' that other flushed,

And hung his head, and halted in reply,

Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,

And after madness acted question asked:

Till Edyrn crying, 'If ye will not go

To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,'

'Enough,' he said, 'I follow,' and they went.

But Enid in their going had two fears,

One from the bandit scattered in the field,

And one from Edyrn.  Every now and then,

When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,

She shrank a little.  In a hollow land,

From which old fires have broken, men may fear

Fresh fire and ruin.  He, perceiving, said:


'Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause

To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.

Yourself were first the blameless cause to make

My nature's prideful sparkle in the blood

Break into furious flame; being repulsed

By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought

Until I overturned him; then set up

(With one main purpose ever at my heart)

My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;

Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,

And, toppling over all antagonism,

So waxed in pride, that I believed myself

Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:

And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,

I should have slain your father, seized yourself.

I lived in hope that sometime you would come

To these my lists with him whom best you loved;

And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes

The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,

Behold me overturn and trample on him.

Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,

I should not less have killed him.  And so you came,--

But once you came,--and with your own true eyes

Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one

Speaks of a service done him) overthrow

My proud self, and my purpose three years old,

And set his foot upon me, and give me life.

There was I broken down; there was I saved:

Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life

He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.

And all the penance the Queen laid upon me

Was but to rest awhile within her court;

Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,

And waiting to be treated like a wolf,

Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,

Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,

Such fine reserve and noble reticence,

Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace

Of tenderest courtesy, that I began

To glance behind me at my former life,

And find that it had been the wolf's indeed:

And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,

Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,

Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,

Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.

And you were often there about the Queen,

But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;

Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,

But kept myself aloof till I was changed;

And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.'


He spoke, and Enid easily believed,

Like simple noble natures, credulous

Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,

There most in those who most have done them ill.

And when they reached the camp the King himself

Advanced to greet them, and beholding her

Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,

But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held

In converse for a little, and returned,

And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,

And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,

And showed an empty tent allotted her,

And glancing for a minute, till he saw her

Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:


'Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave

To move to your own land, and there defend

Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,

As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,

By having looked too much through alien eyes,

And wrought too long with delegated hands,

Not used mine own:  but now behold me come

To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,

With Edyrn and with others:  have ye looked

At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?

This work of his is great and wonderful.

His very face with change of heart is changed.

The world will not believe a man repents:

And this wise world of ours is mainly right.

Full seldom doth a man repent, or use

Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch

Of blood and custom wholly out of him,

And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.

Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart

As I will weed this land before I go.

I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,

Not rashly, but have proved him everyway

One of our noblest, our most valorous,

Sanest and most obedient:  and indeed

This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself

After a life of violence, seems to me

A thousand-fold more great and wonderful

Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,

My subject with my subjects under him,

Should make an onslaught single on a realm

Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,

And were himself nigh wounded to the death.'


So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt

His work was neither great nor wonderful,

And past to Enid's tent; and thither came

The King's own leech to look into his hurt;

And Enid tended on him there; and there

Her constant motion round him, and the breath

Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,

Filled all the genial courses of his blood

With deeper and with ever deeper love,

As the south-west that blowing Bala lake

Fills all the sacred Dee.  So past the days.


But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,

The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes

On each of all whom Uther left in charge

Long since, to guard the justice of the King:

He looked and found them wanting; and as now

Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills

To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,

He rooted out the slothful officer

Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,

And in their chairs set up a stronger race

With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men

To till the wastes, and moving everywhere

Cleared the dark places and let in the law,

And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.


Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past

With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.

There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,

And clothed her in apparel like the day.

And though Geraint could never take again

That comfort from their converse which he took

Before the Queen's fair name was breathed upon,

He rested well content that all was well.

Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,

And fifty knights rode with them to the shores

Of Severn, and they past to their own land.

And there he kept the justice of the King

So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts

Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:

And being ever foremost in the chase,

And victor at the tilt and tournament,

They called him the great Prince and man of men.

But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call

Enid the Fair, a grateful people named

Enid the Good; and in their halls arose

The cry of children, Enids and Geraints

Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,

But rested in her falty, till he crowned

A happy life with a fair death, and fell

Against the heathen of the Northern Sea

In battle, fighting for the blameless King.

Poem 33: Guinevere

Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat

There in the holy house at Almesbury

Weeping, none with her save a little maid,

A novice:  one low light betwixt them burned

Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,

Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,

The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,

Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.


For hither had she fled, her cause of flight

Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast

Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,

Ready to spring, waiting a chance:  for this

He chilled the popular praises of the King

With silent smiles of slow disparagement;

And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,

Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought

To make disruption in the Table Round

Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds

Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims

Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.


For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,

Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,

Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,

That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,

Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall

To spy some secret scandal if he might,

And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best

Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court

The wiliest and the worst; and more than this

He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by

Spied where he couched, and as the gardener's hand

Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,

So from the high wall and the flowering grove

Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,

And cast him as a worm upon the way;

But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,

He, reverencing king's blood in a bad man,

Made such excuses as he might, and these

Full knightly without scorn; for in those days

No knight of Arthur's noblest dealt in scorn;

But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him

By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,

Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,

And he was answered softly by the King

And all his Table.  So Sir Lancelot holp

To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice

Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:

But, ever after, the small violence done

Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,

As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long

A little bitter pool about a stone

On the bare coast.


                 But when Sir Lancelot told

This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed

Lightly, to think of Modred's dusty fall,

Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries

`I shudder, some one steps across my grave;'

Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed

She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,

Would track her guilt until he found, and hers

Would be for evermore a name of scorn.

Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,

Or elsewhere, Modred's narrow foxy face,

Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:

Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,

To help it from the death that cannot die,

And save it even in extremes, began

To vex and plague her.  Many a time for hours,

Beside the placid breathings of the King,

In the dead night, grim faces came and went

Before her, or a vague spiritual fear--

Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,

Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,

That keeps the rust of murder on the walls--

Held her awake:  or if she slept, she dreamed

An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand

On some vast plain before a setting sun,

And from the sun there swiftly made at her

A ghastly something, and its shadow flew

Before it, till it touched her, and she turned--

When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,

And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it

Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.

And all this trouble did not pass but grew;

Till even the clear face of the guileless King,

And trustful courtesies of household life,

Became her bane; and at the last she said,

`O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,

For if thou tarry we shall meet again,

And if we meet again, some evil chance

Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze

Before the people, and our lord the King.'

And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,

And still they met and met.  Again she said,

`O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.'

And then they were agreed upon a night

(When the good King should not be there) to meet

And part for ever.  Vivien, lurking, heard.

She told Sir Modred.  Passion-pale they met

And greeted.  Hands in hands, and eye to eye,

Low on the border of her couch they sat

Stammering and staring.  It was their last hour,

A madness of farewells.  And Modred brought

His creatures to the basement of the tower

For testimony; and crying with full voice

`Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,' aroused

Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike

Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell

Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,

And all was still:  then she, `The end is come,

And I am shamed for ever;' and he said,

`Mine be the shame; mine was the sin:  but rise,

And fly to my strong castle overseas:

There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,

There hold thee with my life against the world.'

She answered, `Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?

Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.

Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!

Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou

Unwedded:  yet rise now, and let us fly,

For I will draw me into sanctuary,

And bide my doom.'  So Lancelot got her horse,

Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,

And then they rode to the divided way,

There kissed, and parted weeping:  for he past,

Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,

Back to his land; but she to Almesbury

Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,

And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald

Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:

And in herself she moaned `Too late, too late!'

Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,

A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,

Croaked, and she thought, `He spies a field of death;

For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,

Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,

Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.'


And when she came to Almesbury she spake

There to the nuns, and said, `Mine enemies

Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,

Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask

Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time

To tell you:' and her beauty, grace and power,

Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared

To ask it.


         So the stately Queen abode

For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;

Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,

Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,

But communed only with the little maid,

Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness

Which often lured her from herself; but now,

This night, a rumour wildly blown about

Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,

And leagued him with the heathen, while the King

Was waging war on Lancelot:  then she thought,

`With what a hate the people and the King

Must hate me,' and bowed down upon her hands

Silent, until the little maid, who brooked

No silence, brake it, uttering, `Late! so late!

What hour, I wonder, now?' and when she drew

No answer, by and by began to hum

An air the nuns had taught her; `Late, so late!'

Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,

`O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,

Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.'

Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.


`Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!

Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.

Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.


`No light had we:  for that we do repent;

And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.

Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.


`No light:  so late! and dark and chill the night!

O let us in, that we may find the light!

Too late, too late:  ye cannot enter now.


`Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?

O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!

No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.'


So sang the novice, while full passionately,

Her head upon her hands, remembering

Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.

Then said the little novice prattling to her,

`O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;

But let my words, the words of one so small,

Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,

And if I do not there is penance given--

Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow

From evil done; right sure am I of that,

Who see your tender grace and stateliness.

But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King's,

And weighing find them less; for gone is he

To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,

Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;

And Modred whom he left in charge of all,

The traitor--Ah sweet lady, the King's grief

For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,

Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.

For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.

For if there ever come a grief to me

I cry my cry in silence, and have done.

None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:

But even were the griefs of little ones

As great as those of great ones, yet this grief

Is added to the griefs the great must bear,

That howsoever much they may desire

Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:

As even here they talk at Almesbury

About the good King and his wicked Queen,

And were I such a King with such a Queen,

Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,

But were I such a King, it could not be.'


Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,

`Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?'

But openly she answered, `Must not I,

If this false traitor have displaced his lord,

Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?'


`Yea,' said the maid, `this is all woman's grief,

That SHE is woman, whose disloyal life

Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round

Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,

With signs and miracles and wonders, there

At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.'


Then thought the Queen within herself again,

`Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?'

But openly she spake and said to her,

`O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,

What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,

Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs

And simple miracles of thy nunnery?'


To whom the little novice garrulously,

`Yea, but I know:  the land was full of signs

And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.

So said my father, and himself was knight

Of the great Table--at the founding of it;

And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said

That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain

After the sunset, down the coast, he heard

Strange music, and he paused, and turning--there,

All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,

Each with a beacon-star upon his head,

And with a wild sea-light about his feet,

He saw them--headland after headland flame

Far on into the rich heart of the west:

And in the light the white mermaiden swam,

And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,

And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,

To which the little elves of chasm and cleft

Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.

So said my father--yea, and furthermore,

Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,

Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy

Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,

That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes

When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:

And still at evenings on before his horse

The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke

Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke

Flying, for all the land was full of life.

And when at last he came to Camelot,

A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand

Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;

And in the hall itself was such a feast

As never man had dreamed; for every knight

Had whatsoever meat he longed for served

By hands unseen; and even as he said

Down in the cellars merry bloated things

Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts

While the wine ran:  so glad were spirits and men

Before the coming of the sinful Queen.'


Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,

`Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,

Spirits and men:  could none of them foresee,

Not even thy wise father with his signs

And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?'


To whom the novice garrulously again,

`Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,

Full many a noble war-song had he sung,

Even in the presence of an enemy's fleet,

Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;

And many a mystic lay of life and death

Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,

When round him bent the spirits of the hills

With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:

So said my father--and that night the bard

Sang Arthur's glorious wars, and sang the King

As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those

Who called him the false son of Gorlos:

For there was no man knew from whence he came;

But after tempest, when the long wave broke

All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,

There came a day as still as heaven, and then

They found a naked child upon the sands

Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;

And that was Arthur; and they fostered him

Till he by miracle was approven King:

And that his grave should be a mystery

From all men, like his birth; and could he find

A woman in her womanhood as great

As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,

The twain together well might change the world.

But even in the middle of his song

He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,

And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,

But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell

His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw

This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?'


Then thought the Queen, `Lo! they have set her on,

Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,

To play upon me,' and bowed her head nor spake.

Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,

Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,

Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue

Full often, `and, sweet lady, if I seem

To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,

Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales

Which my good father told me, check me too

Nor let me shame my father's memory, one

Of noblest manners, though himself would say

Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,

Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,

And left me; but of others who remain,

And of the two first-famed for courtesy--

And pray you check me if I ask amiss-

But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved

Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?'


Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,

`Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,

Was gracious to all ladies, and the same

In open battle or the tilting-field

Forbore his own advantage, and the King

In open battle or the tilting-field

Forbore his own advantage, and these two

Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;

For manners are not idle, but the fruit

Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.'


`Yea,' said the maid, `be manners such fair fruit?'

Then Lancelot's needs must be a thousand-fold

Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,

The most disloyal friend in all the world.'


To which a mournful answer made the Queen:

`O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,

What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights

And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?

If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,

Were for one hour less noble than himself,

Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,

And weep for her that drew him to his doom.'


`Yea,' said the little novice, `I pray for both;

But I should all as soon believe that his,

Sir Lancelot's, were as noble as the King's,

As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be

Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.'


So she, like many another babbler, hurt

Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;

For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat

Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,

`Such as thou art be never maiden more

For ever! thou their tool, set on to plague

And play upon, and harry me, petty spy

And traitress.'  When that storm of anger brake

From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,

White as her veil, and stood before the Queen

As tremulously as foam upon the beach

Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,

And when the Queen had added `Get thee hence,'

Fled frighted.  Then that other left alone

Sighed, and began to gather heart again,

Saying in herself, `The simple, fearful child

Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,

Simpler than any child, betrays itself.

But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.

For what is true repentance but in thought--

Not even in inmost thought to think again

The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:

And I have sworn never to see him more,

To see him more.'


                And even in saying this,

Her memory from old habit of the mind

Went slipping back upon the golden days

In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,

Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,

Ambassador, to lead her to his lord

Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead

Of his and her retinue moving, they,

Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love

And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time

Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,)

Rode under groves that looked a paradise

Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth

That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,

And on from hill to hill, and every day

Beheld at noon in some delicious dale

The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised

For brief repast or afternoon repose

By couriers gone before; and on again,

Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw

The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,

That crowned the state pavilion of the King,

Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.


But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,

And moving through the past unconsciously,

Came to that point where first she saw the King

Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find

Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,

High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,

`Not like my Lancelot'--while she brooded thus

And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,

There rode an armd warrior to the doors.

A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,

Then on a sudden a cry, `The King.'  She sat

Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armd feet

Through the long gallery from the outer doors

Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,

And grovelled with her face against the floor:

There with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair

She made her face a darkness from the King:

And in the darkness heard his armd feet

Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,

Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost's

Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King's:


`Liest thou here so low, the child of one

I honoured, happy, dead before thy shame?

Well is it that no child is born of thee.

The children born of thee are sword and fire,

Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws,

The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts

Of heathen swarming o'er the Northern Sea;

Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm,

The mightiest of my knights, abode with me,

Have everywhere about this land of Christ

In twelve great battles ruining overthrown.

And knowest thou now from whence I come--from him

From waging bitter war with him:  and he,

That did not shun to smite me in worse way,

Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left,

He spared to lift his hand against the King

Who made him knight:  but many a knight was slain;

And many more, and all his kith and kin

Clave to him, and abode in his own land.

And many more when Modred raised revolt,

Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave

To Modred, and a remnant stays with me.

And of this remnant will I leave a part,

True men who love me still, for whom I live,

To guard thee in the wild hour coming on,

Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed.

Fear not:  thou shalt be guarded till my death.

Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies

Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom.

Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me,

That I the King should greatly care to live;

For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life.

Bear with me for the last time while I show,

Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned.

For when the Roman left us, and their law

Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways

Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed

Of prowess done redressed a random wrong.

But I was first of all the kings who drew

The knighthood-errant of this realm and all

The realms together under me, their Head,

In that fair Order of my Table Round,

A glorious company, the flower of men,

To serve as model for the mighty world,

And be the fair beginning of a time.

I made them lay their hands in mine and swear

To reverence the King, as if he were

Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,

To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,

To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,

To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,

To honour his own word as if his God's,

To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,

To love one maiden only, cleave to her,

And worship her by years of noble deeds,

Until they won her; for indeed I knew

Of no more subtle master under heaven

Than is the maiden passion for a maid,

Not only to keep down the base in man,

But teach high thought, and amiable words

And courtliness, and the desire of fame,

And love of truth, and all that makes a man.

And all this throve before I wedded thee,

Believing, "lo mine helpmate, one to feel

My purpose and rejoicing in my joy."

Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot;

Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt;

Then others, following these my mightiest knights,

And drawing foul ensample from fair names,

Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite

Of all my heart had destined did obtain,

And all through thee! so that this life of mine

I guard as God's high gift from scathe and wrong,

Not greatly care to lose; but rather think

How sad it were for Arthur, should he live,

To sit once more within his lonely hall,

And miss the wonted number of my knights,

And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds

As in the golden days before thy sin.

For which of us, who might be left, could speak

Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee?

And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk

Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,

And I should evermore be vext with thee

In hanging robe or vacant ornament,

Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair.

For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord,

Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee.

I am not made of so slight elements.

Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame.

I hold that man the worst of public foes

Who either for his own or children's sake,

To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife

Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house:

For being through his cowardice allowed

Her station, taken everywhere for pure,

She like a new disease, unknown to men,

Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd,

Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps

The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse

With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young.

Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns!

Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart

Than thou reseated in thy place of light,

The mockery of my people, and their bane.'


He paused, and in the pause she crept an inch

Nearer, and laid her hands about his feet.

Far off a solitary trumpet blew.

Then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed

At a friend's voice, and he spake again:


`Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,

I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,

I, whose vast pity almost makes me die

To see thee, laying there thy golden head,

My pride in happier summers, at my feet.

The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,

The doom of treason and the flaming death,

(When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past.

The pang--which while I weighed thy heart with one

Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,

Made my tears burn--is also past--in part.

And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I,

Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God

Forgives:  do thou for thine own soul the rest.

But how to take last leave of all I loved?

O golden hair, with which I used to play

Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form,

And beauty such as never woman wore,

Until it became a kingdom's curse with thee--

I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,

But Lancelot's:  nay, they never were the King's.

I cannot take thy hand:  that too is flesh,

And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,

Here looking down on thine polluted, cries

"I loathe thee:" yet not less, O Guinevere,

For I was ever virgin save for thee,

My love through flesh hath wrought into my life

So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.

Let no man dream but that I love thee still.

Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,

And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,

Hereafter in that world where all are pure

We two may meet before high God, and thou

Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know

I am thine husband--not a smaller soul,

Nor Lancelot, nor another.  Leave me that,

I charge thee, my last hope.  Now must I hence.

Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow:

They summon me their King to lead mine hosts

Far down to that great battle in the west,

Where I must strike against the man they call

My sister's son--no kin of mine, who leagues

With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights,

Traitors--and strike him dead, and meet myself

Death, or I know not what mysterious doom.

And thou remaining here wilt learn the event;

But hither shall I never come again,

Never lie by thy side; see thee no more--

Farewell!'


         And while she grovelled at his feet,

She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck,

And in the darkness o'er her fallen head,

Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.


Then, listening till those armd steps were gone,

Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found

The casement:  `peradventure,' so she thought,

`If I might see his face, and not be seen.'

And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!

And near him the sad nuns with each a light

Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,

To guard and foster her for evermore.

And while he spake to these his helm was lowered,

To which for crest the golden dragon clung

Of Britain; so she did not see the face,

Which then was as an angel's, but she saw,

Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,

The Dragon of the great Pendragonship

Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.

And even then he turned; and more and more

The moony vapour rolling round the King,

Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it,

Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray

And grayer, till himself became as mist

Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.


Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud

`Oh Arthur!' there her voice brake suddenly,

Then--as a stream that spouting from a cliff

Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base

Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale--

Went on in passionate utterance:


                               `Gone--my lord!

Gone through my sin to slay and to be slain!

And he forgave me, and I could not speak.

Farewell?  I should have answered his farewell.

His mercy choked me.  Gone, my lord the King,

My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?

The shadow of another cleaves to me,

And makes me one pollution:  he, the King,

Called me polluted:  shall I kill myself?

What help in that?  I cannot kill my sin,

If soul be soul; nor can I kill my shame;

No, nor by living can I live it down.

The days will grow to weeks, the weeks to months

The months will add themselves and make the years,

The years will roll into the centuries,

And mine will ever be a name of scorn.

I must not dwell on that defeat of fame.

Let the world be; that is but of the world.

What else? what hope? I think there was a hope,

Except he mocked me when he spake of hope;

His hope he called it; but he never mocks,

For mockery is the fume of little hearts.

And blessd be the King, who hath forgiven

My wickedness to him, and left me hope

That in mine own heart I can live down sin

And be his mate hereafter in the heavens

Before high God.  Ah great and gentle lord,

Who wast, as is the conscience of a saint

Among his warring senses, to thy knights--

To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took

Full easily all impressions from below,

Would not look up, or half-despised the height

To which I would not or I could not climb--

I thought I could not breathe in that fine air

That pure severity of perfect light--

I yearned for warmth and colour which I found

In Lancelot--now I see thee what thou art,

Thou art the highest and most human too,

Not Lancelot, nor another.  Is there none

Will tell the King I love him though so late?

Now--ere he goes to the great Battle? none:

Myself must tell him in that purer life,

But now it were too daring.  Ah my God,

What might I not have made of thy fair world,

Had I but loved thy highest creature here?

It was my duty to have loved the highest:

It surely was my profit had I known:

It would have been my pleasure had I seen.

We needs must love the highest when we see it,

Not Lancelot, nor another.'


                          Here her hand

Grasped, made her vail her eyes:  she looked and saw

The novice, weeping, suppliant, and said to her,

`Yea, little maid, for am I not forgiven?'

Then glancing up beheld the holy nuns

All round her, weeping; and her heart was loosed

Within her, and she wept with these and said,


`Ye know me then, that wicked one, who broke

The vast design and purpose of the King.

O shut me round with narrowing nunnery-walls,

Meek maidens, from the voices crying "shame."

I must not scorn myself:  he loves me still.

Let no one dream but that he loves me still.

So let me, if you do not shudder at me,

Nor shun to call me sister, dwell with you;

Wear black and white, and be a nun like you,

Fast with your fasts, not feasting with your feasts;

Grieve with your griefs, not grieving at your joys,

But not rejoicing; mingle with your rites;

Pray and be prayed for; lie before your shrines;

Do each low office of your holy house;

Walk your dim cloister, and distribute dole

To poor sick people, richer in His eyes

Who ransomed us, and haler too than I;

And treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own;

And so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer

The sombre close of that voluptuous day,

Which wrought the ruin of my lord the King.'


She said:  they took her to themselves; and she

Still hoping, fearing `is it yet too late?'

Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.

Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,

And for the power of ministration in her,

And likewise for the high rank she had borne,

Was chosen Abbess, there, an Abbess, lived

For three brief years, and there, an Abbess, past

To where beyond these voices there is peace.

Poem 34: Hendecasyllabics

O you chorus of indolent reviewers,

Irresponsible, indolent reviewers,

Look, I come to the test, a tiny poem

All composed in a metre of Catullus,

All in quantity, careful of my motion,

Like the skater on ice that hardly bears him,

Lest I fall unawares before the people,

Waking laughter in indolent reviewers.

Should I flounder awhile without a tumble

Thro' this metrification of Catullus,

They should speak to me not without a welcome,

All that chorus of indolent reviewers.

Hard, hard, hard it is, only not to tumble,

So fantastical is the dainty meter.

Wherefore slight me not wholly, nor believe me

Too presumptuous, indolent reviewers.

O blatant Magazines, regard me rather -

Since I blush to belaud myself a moment -

As some rare little rose, a piece of inmost

Horticultural art, or half-coquette-like

Maiden, not to be greeted unbenignly

Poem 35: Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead

Home they brought her warrior dead:

 She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:

All her maidens, watching, said,

 ‘She must weep or she will die.’


Then they praised him, soft and low,

 Called him worthy to be loved,

Truest friend and noblest foe;

 Yet she neither spoke nor moved.


Stole a maiden from her place,

 Lightly to the warrior stepped,

Took the face-cloth from the face;

 Yet she neither moved nor wept.


Rose a nurse of ninety years,

 Set his child upon her knee—

Like summer tempest came her tears—

 ‘Sweet my child, I live for thee.’

Poem 36: How Thought You That This Thing Could Captivate?

How thought you that this thing could captivate?

   What are those graces that could make her dear,

   Who is not worth the notice of a sneer,

To rouse the vapid devil of her hate?

A speech conventional, so void of weight,

   That after it has buzzed about one's ear,

   'Twere rich refreshment for a week to hear

The dentist babble or the barber prate;


A hand displayed with many a little art;

   An eye that glances on her neighbor's dress;

       A foot too often shown for my regard;

An angel's form -- a waiting-woman's heart;

   A perfect-featured face, expressionless,

       Insipid, as the Queen upon a card.

Poem 37: Idylls Of The King: Song From The Marriage Of Geraint

Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;

  Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud;

  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.


        Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;

  With that wild wheel we go not up or down;

  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.


        Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;

  Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;

  For man is man and master of his fate.


        Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;

  Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;

  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

Poem 38: Idylls of the King: The Last Tournament (excerpt)

Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood

    Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,

    At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,

    Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall.

    And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,

    And from the crown thereof a carcanet

    Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize

    Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,

    Came Tristram, saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"


       For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once

   Far down beneath a winding wall of rock

   Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead.

   From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,

   Clutch'd at the crag, and started thro' mid air

   Bearing an eagle's nest: and thro' the tree

   Rush'd ever a rainy wind, and thro' the wind

   Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and tree

   Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,

   This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,

   And all unscarr'd from beak or talon, brought

   A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,

   Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen

   But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms

   Received, and after loved it tenderly,

   And named it Nestling; so forgot herself

   A moment, and her cares; till that young life

   Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold

   Past from her; and in time the carcanet

   Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:

   So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,

   "Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,

   And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize."


       To whom the King, "Peace to thine eagle-borne

   Dead nestling, and this honour after death,

   Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse

   Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone

   Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,

   And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear."


       "Would rather you had let them fall," she cried,

   "Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,

   A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,

   Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--

   Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out

   Above the river--that unhappy child

   Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go

   With these rich jewels, seeing that they came

   Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,

   But the sweet body of a maiden babe.

   Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights

   May win them for the purest of my maids."


       She ended, and the cry of a great jousts

   With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways

   From Camelot in among the faded fields

   To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights

   Arm'd for a day of glory before the King.


       But on the hither side of that loud morn

   Into the hall stagger'd, his visage ribb'd

   From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose

   Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,

    And one with shatter'd fingers dangling lame,

   A churl, to whom indignantly the King,


       "My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast

   Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?

   Man was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"


       Then, sputtering thro' the hedge of splinter'd teeth,

   Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump

   Pitch-blacken'd sawing the air, said the maim'd churl,


       "He took them and he drave them to his tower--

   Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--

   A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--

   Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight

   Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;

   And when I cal'd upon thy name as one

   That doest right by gentle and by churl,

   Maim'd me and maul'd, and would outright have slain,

   Save that he aware me to a message, saying,

   'Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I

   Have founded my Round Table in the North,

   And whatsoever his own knights have sworn

   My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say

   My tower is full of harlots, like his court,

   But mine are worthier, seeing they profess

   To be none other than themselves--and say

   My knights are all adulterers like his own,

   But mine are truer, seeing they profess

   To be none other; and say his hour is come,

   The heathen are upon him, his long lance

   Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.' "


       Then Arthur turn'd to Kay the seneschal,

   "Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously

   Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.

   The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,

   Hurl'd back again so often in empty foam,

   Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,

   Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom

   The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,

   Friends, thro' your manhood and your fealty,--now

   Make their last head like Satan in the North.

   My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower

  Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,

  Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,

  The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.

  But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place

  Enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the field;

  For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it

  Only to yield my Queen her own again?

  Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?"



     Thereto Sir Lancelot answer'd, "It is well:

  Yet better if the King abide, and leave

  The leading of his younger knights to me.

  Else, for the King has will'd it, it is well."



     Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow'd him,

  And while they stood without the doors, the King

  Turn'd to him saying, "Is it then so well?

  Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he

  Of whom was written, 'A sound is in his ears'?

  The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance

  That only seems half-loyal to command,--

  A manner somewhat fall'n from reverence--

  Or have I dream'd the bearing of our knights

  Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?

  Or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd,

  By noble deeds at one with noble vows,

  From flat confusion and brute violence,s

  Reel back into the beast, and be no more?"



     He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,

  Down the slope city rode, and sharply turn'd

  North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen,

  Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,

  Watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she sigh'd.

  Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme

  Of bygone Merlin, "Where is he who knows?

  From the great deep to the great deep he goes."



     But when the morning of a tournament,

  By these in earnest those in mockery call'd

  The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,

  Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,

  Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,

  The words of Arthur flying shriek'd, arose,

  And down a streetway hung with folds of pure

  White samite, and by fountains running wine,

  Where children sat in white with cups of gold,

  Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps

  Ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd chair.



     He glanced and saw the stately galleries,

  Dame, damsel, each thro' worship of their Queen

  White-robed in honour of the stainless child,

  And some with scatter'd jewels, like a bank

  Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.

  He look'd but once, and vail'd his eyes again.



     The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream

  To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll

  Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:

  And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf

  And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume

  Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one

  Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,

  When all the goodlier guests are past away,

  Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.

  He saw the laws that ruled the tournament

  Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down

  Before his throne of arbitration cursed

  The dead babe and the follies of the King;

  And once the laces of a helmet crack'd,

  And show'd him, like a vermin in its hole,

  Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard

  The voice that billow'd round the barriers roar

  An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,

  But newly-enter'd, taller than the rest,

  And armour'd all in forest green, whereon

  There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,

  And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,

  With ever-scattering berries, and on shield

  A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late

  From overseas in Brittany return'd,

  And marriage with a princess of that realm,

  Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--

  Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain

  His own against him, and now yearn'd to shake

  The burthen off his heart in one full shock

  With Tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands gript

  And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,

  Until he groan'd for wrath--so many of those,

  That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,

  Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,

  And there with gibes and flickering mockeries

  Stood, while he mutter'd, "Craven crests! O shame!

  What faith have these in whom they sware to love?

  The glory of our Round Table is no more."



     So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,

  Not speaking other word than "Hast thou won?

  Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand

  Wherewith thou takest this, is red!" to whom

  Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,

  Made answer, "Ay, but wherefore toss me this

  Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?

  Let be thy fair Queen's fantasy. Strength of heart

  And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,

  Are winners in this pastime of our King.

  My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--

  No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,

  Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,

  Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;

  Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine."



     And Tristram round the gallery made his horse

  Caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly saying,

  "Fair damsels, each to him who worships each

  Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold

  This day my Queen of Beauty is not here."

  And most of these were mute, some anger'd, one

  Murmuring, "All courtesy is dead," and one

  "The glory of our Round Table is no more."



     Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,

  And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day

  Went glooming down in wet and weariness:

  But under her black brows a swarthy one

  Laugh'd shrilly, crying, "Praise the patient saints,

  Our one white day of Innocence hath past,

  Tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.

  The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year,

  Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.

  Come--let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's

  And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity

  With all the kindlier colours of the field."



     So dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast

  Variously gay: for he that tells the tale

  Liken'd them, saying, as when an hour of cold

  Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,

  And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers

  Pass under white, till the warm hour returns

  With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;

  So dame and damsel cast the simple white,

  And glowing in all colours, the live grass,

  Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced

  About the revels, and with mirth so loud

  Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,

  And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,

  Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower

  Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.



     And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,

  High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,

  Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall.

  Then Tristram saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"

  Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet replied,

  "Belike for lack of wiser company;

  Or being fool, and seeing too much wit

  Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip

  To know myself the wisest knight of all."

  "Ay, fool," said Tristram, "but 'tis eating dry

  To dance without a catch, a roundelay

  To dance to." Then he twangled on his harp,

  And while he twangled little Dagonet stood

  Quiet as any water-sodden log

  Stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook;

  But when the twangling ended, skipt again;

  And being ask'd, "Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?"

  Made answer, "I had liefer twenty years

  Skip to the broken music of my brains

  Than any broken music thou canst make."

  Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,

  "Good now, what music have I broken, fool?"

  And little Dagonet, skipping, "Arthur, the King's;

  For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,

  Thou makest broken music with thy bride,

  Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--

  And so thou breakest Arthur's music, too."

  "Save for that broken music in thy brains,

  Sir Fool," said Tristram, "I would break thy head.

  Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were o'er,

  The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--

  I am but a fool to reason with a fool--

  Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down,

  Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,

  And harken if my music be not true.



     "`Free love--free field--we love but while we may:

  The woods are hush'd, their music is no more:

  The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:

  New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:

  New life, new love, to suit the newer day:

  New loves are sweet as those that went before:

  Free love--free field--we love but while we may.'



     "Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,

  Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,

  And heard it ring as true as tested gold."



     But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,

  "Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday

  Made to run wine?--but this had run itself

  All out like a long life to a sour end--

  And them that round it sat with golden cups

  To hand the wine to whosoever came--

  The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,

  In honour of poor Innocence the babe,

  Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen

  Lent to the King, and Innocence the King

  Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips

  Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,

  'Drink, drink, Sir Fool,' and thereupon I drank,

  Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud."



     And Tristram, "Was it muddier than thy gibes?

  Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--

  Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--

  'Fear God: honour the King--his one true knight--

  Sole follower of the vows'--for here be they

  Who knew thee swine enow before I came,

  Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King

  Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up

  It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;

  Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,

  A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,

  For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine."



     And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,

  "Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck

  In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch

  Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.

  Swine? I have wallow'd, I have wash'd--the world

  Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.

  The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind

  Hath foul'd me--an I wallow'd, then I wash'd--

  I have had my day and my philosophies--

  And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.

  Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese

  Troop'd round a Paynim harper once, who thrumm'd

  On such a wire as musically as thou

  Some such fine song--but never a king's fool."



     And Tristram, "Then were swine, goats, asses, geese

  The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard

  Had such a mastery of his mystery

  That he could harp his wife up out of hell."



     Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,

  "And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself

  Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,

  That harpest downward! dost thou know the star

  We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?"



     And Tristram, "Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King

  Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,

  Glorying in each new glory, set his name

  High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven."



     And Dagonet answer'd, "Ay, and when the land

  Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself

  To babble about him, all to show your wit--

  And whether he were King by courtesy,

  Or King by right--and so went harping down

  The black king's highway, got so far, and grew

  So witty that we play'd at ducks and drakes

  With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.

  Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?"



     "Nay, fool," said Tristram, "not in open day."

  And Dagonet, "Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.

  It makes a silent music up in heaven,

  And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,

  And then we skip." "Lo, fool," he said, "ye talk

  Fool's treason: is the King thy brother fool?"

  Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrill'd,

  "Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!

  Conceits himself as God that he can make

  Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk

  From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs

  And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!"



     And down the city Dagonet danced away;

  But thro' the slowly-mellowing avenues

  And solitary passes of the wood

  Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.

  Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt

  With ruby-circled neck, but evermore

  Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood

  Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye

  For all that walk'd, or crept, or perch'd, or flew.

  Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,

  Unruffling waters re-collect the shape

  Of one that in them sees himself, return'd;

  But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,

  Or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd again.



     So on for all that day from lawn to lawn

  Thro' many a league-long bower he rode. At length

  A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs

  Furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which himself

  Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt

  Against a shower, dark in the golden grove

  Appearing, sent his fancy back to where

  She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:

  Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,

  With six or seven, when Tristram was away,

  And snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than shame

  Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,

  But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.



     And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt

  So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank

  Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;

  But could not rest for musing how to smoothe

  And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.

  Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all

  The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.

  But then what folly had sent him overseas

  After she left him lonely here? a name?

  Was it the name of one in Brittany,

  Isolt, the daughter of the King? "Isolt

  Of the white hands" they call'd her: the sweet name

  Allured him first, and then the maid herself,

  Who served him well with those white hands of hers,

  And loved him well, until himself had thought

  He loved her also, wedded easily,

  But left her all as easily, and return'd.

  The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes

  Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid

  His brows upon the drifted leaf and dream'd.



     He seem'd to pace the strand of Brittany

  Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,

  And show'd them both the ruby-chain, and both

  Began to struggle for it, till his Queen

  Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.

  Then cried the Breton, "Look, her hand is red!

  These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,

  And melts within her hand--her hand is hot

  With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,

  Is all as cool and white as any flower."

  Follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and then

  A whimpering of the spirit of the child,

  Because the twain had spoil'd her carcanet.



     He dream'd; but Arthur with a hundred spears

  Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,

  And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,

  The wide-wing'd sunset of the misty marsh

  Glared on a huge machicolated tower

  That stood with open doors, where out was roll'd

  A roar of riot, as from men secure

  Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease

  Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.

  "Lo there," said one of Arthur's youth, for there,

  High on a grim dead tree before the tower,

  A goodly brother of the Table Round

  Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield

  Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,

  And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights

  At that dishonour done the gilded spur,

  Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.

  But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode.

  Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,

  That sent the face of all the marsh aloft

  An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud

  Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,

  Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm

  In blood-red armour sallying, howl'd to the King,



     "The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!

  Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King

  Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--

  The woman-worshipper? Yea, God's curse, and I!

  Slain was the brother of my paramour

  By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine

  And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,

  Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,

  And stings itself to everlasting death,

  To hang whatever knight of thine I fought

  And tumbled. Art thou King?--Look to thy life!"



     He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face

  Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name

  Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.

  And Arthur deign'd not use of word or sword,

  But let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from horse

  To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,

  Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp

  Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,

  Heard in dead night along that table-shore,

  Drops flat, and after the great waters break

  Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,

  Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,

  From less and less to nothing; thus he fell

  Head-heavy; then the knights, who watch'd him, roar'd

  And shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n;

  There trampled out his face from being known,

  And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:

  Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang

  Thro' open doors, and swording right and left

  Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl'd

  The tables over and the wines, and slew

  Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,

  And all the pavement stream'd with massacre:

  Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,

  Which half that autumn night, like the live North,

  Red-pulsing up thro' Alioth and Alcor,

  Made all above it, and a hundred meres

  About it, as the water Moab saw

  Come round by the East, and out beyond them flush'd

  The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.



     So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,

  But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.



     Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream

  Fled with a shout, and that low lodge return'd,

  Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.

  He whistled his good warhorse left to graze

  Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,

  And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,

  Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,

  Stay'd him. "Why weep ye?" "Lord," she said, "my man

  Hath left me or is dead"; whereon he thought--

  "What, if she hate me now? I would not this.

  What, if she love me still? I would not that.

  I know not what I would"--but said to her,

  "Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,

  He find thy favour changed and love thee not"--

  Then pressing day by day thro' Lyonnesse

  Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard

  The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds

  Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gain'd

  Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,

  A crown of towers.       Down in a casement sat,

  A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair

  And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.

  And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind

  The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,

  Flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and there

  Belted his body with her white embrace,

  Crying aloud, "Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!

  The footstep flutter'd me at first: not he:

  Catlike thro' his own castle steals my Mark,

  But warrior-wise thou stridest thro' his halls

  Who hates thee, as I him--ev'n to the death.

  My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark

  Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh."

  To whom Sir Tristram smiling, "I am here.

  Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine."



     And drawing somewhat backward she replied,

  "Can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his own,

  But save for dread of thee had beaten me,

  Scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow--Mark?

  What rights are his that dare not strike for them?

  Not lift a hand--not, tho' he found me thus!

  But harken! have ye met him? hence he went

  To-day for three days' hunting--as he said--

  And so returns belike within an hour.

  Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,

  Because he hates thee even more than fears;

  Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood

  Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush

  Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.

  My God, the measure of my hate for Mark

  Is as the measure of my love for thee.''



     So, pluck'd one way by hate and one by love,

  Drain'd of her force, again she sat, and spake

  To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,

  "O hunter, and O blower of the horn,

  Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,

  For, ere I mated with my shambling king,

  Ye twain had fallen out about the bride

  Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,

  If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)

  Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks

  To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight,

  What dame or damsel have ye kneel'd to last?"



     And Tristram, "Last to my Queen Paramount,

  Here now to my Queen Paramount of love

  And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first

  Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,

  Sailing from Ireland."          Softly laugh'd Isolt;

  "Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen

  My dole of beauty trebled?" and he said,

  "Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,

  And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--

  Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips

  Most gracious; but she, haughty ev'n to him,

  Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow

  To make one doubt if ever the great Queen

  Have yielded him her love."



           To whom Isolt,

  "Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou

  Who brakest thro' the scruple of my bond,

  Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me

  That Guinevere had sinn'd against the highest,

  And I--misyoked with such a want of man--

  That I could hardly sin against the lowest."



     He answer'd, "O my soul, be comforted!

  If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,

  If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,

  Crown'd warrant had we for the crowning sin

  That made us happy: but how ye greet me--fear

  And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--

  Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories

  Of Tristram in that year he was away."



     And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,

  "I had forgotten all in my strong joy

  To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,

  Here in the never-ended afternoon,

  O sweeter than all memories of thee,

  Deeper than any yearnings after thee

  Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,

  Watch'd from this tower. Isolt of Britain dash'd

  Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,

  Would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? Wedded her?

  Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?

  The King was all fulfill'd with gratefulness,

  And she, my namesake of the hands, that heal'd

  Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--

  Well--can I wish her any huger wrong

  Than having known thee? her too hast thou left

  To pine and waste in those sweet memories.

  O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men

  Are noble, I should hate thee more than love."



     And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,

  "Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well.

  Did I love her? the name at least I loved.

  Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!

  The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!

  The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?

  Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,

  Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God."



     And Isolt answer'd, "Yea, and why not I?

  Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,

  Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.

  Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,

  Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,

  Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,

  And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.

  Then flash'd a levin-brand; and near me stood,

  In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--

  Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--

  For there was Mark: 'He has wedded her,' he said,

  Not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of towers

  So shook to such a roar of all the sky,

  That here in utter dark I swoon'd away,

  And woke again in utter dark, and cried,

  'I will flee hence and give myself to God'--

  And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms."



     Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,

  "May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,

  And past desire!" a saying that anger'd her.'

  "`May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,

  And sweet no more to me!' I need Him now.

  For when had Lancelot utter'd aught so gross

  Ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?

  The greater man, the greater courtesy.

  Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!

  But thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild beasts--

  Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance

  Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.

  How darest thou, if lover, push me even

  In fancy from thy side, and set me far

  In the gray distance, half a life away,

  Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!

  Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,

  Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,

  Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck

  Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.

  Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,

  And solemnly as when ye sware to him

  The man of men, our King--My God, the power

  Was once in vows when men believed the King!

  They lied not then, who sware, and thro' their vows

  The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,

  Swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old,

  Gray-hair'd, and past desire, and in despair."



     Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,

  "Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark

  More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,

  The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--

  My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--

  We run more counter to the soul thereof

  Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.

  I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.

  For once--ev'n to the height--I honour'd him.

  'Man, is he man at all?' methought, when first

  I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld

  That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--

  His hair, a sun that ray'd from off a brow

  Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,

  The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--

  Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,

  With Merlin's mystic babble about his end

  Amazed me; then his foot was on a stool

  Shaped as a dragon; he seem'd to me no man,

  But Michaël trampling Satan; so I sware,

  Being amazed: but this went by--The vows!

  O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--

  They served their use, their time; for every knight

  Believed himself a greater than himself,

  And every follower eyed him as a God;

  Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,

  Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,

  And so the realm was made; but then their vows--

  First mainly thro' that sullying of our Queen--

  Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence

  Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?

  Dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the deep?

  They fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and blood

  Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord

  To bind them by inviolable vows,

  Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:

  For feel this arm of mine--the tide within

  Red with free chase and heather-scented air,

  Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure

  As any maiden child? lock up my tongue

  From uttering freely what I freely hear?

  Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it.

  And worldling of the world am I, and know

  The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour

  Woos his own end; we are not angels here

  Nor shall be: vows--I am woodman of the woods,

  And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale

  Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;

  And therefore is my love so large for thee,

  Seeing it is not bounded save by love."



     Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,

  "Good: an I turn'd away my love for thee

  To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--

  For courtesy wins woman all as well

  As valour may, but he that closes both

  Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,

  Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved

  This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back

  Thine own small saw, 'We love but while we may,'

  Well then, what answer?"          He that while she spake,

  Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,

  The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch

  The warm white apple of her throat, replied,

  "Press this a little closer, sweet, until--

  Come, I am hunger'd and half-anger'd--meat,

  Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,

  And out beyond into the dream to come."



     So then, when both were brought to full accord,

  She rose, and set before him all he will'd;

  And after these had comforted the blood

  With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--

  Now talking of their woodland paradise,

  The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;

  Now mocking at the much ungainliness,

  And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--

  Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:



     "Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!

  A star in heaven, a star within the mere!

  Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,

  And one was far apart, and one was near:

  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!

  And one was water and one star was fire,

  And one will ever shine and one will pass.

  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere."



     Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram show'd

  And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,

  "The collar of some Order, which our King

  Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,

  For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers."



     "Not so, my Queen," he said, "but the red fruit

  Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,

  And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,

  And hither brought by Tristram for his last

  Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee."



     He spoke, he turn'd, then, flinging round her neck,

  Claspt it, and cried "Thine Order, O my Queen!"

  But, while he bow'd to kiss the jewell'd throat,

  Out of the dark, just as the lips had touch'd,

  Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--

  "Mark's way," said Mark, and clove him thro' the brain.



     That night came Arthur home, and while he climb'd,

  All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,

  The stairway to the hall, and look'd and saw

  The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet

  A voice clung sobbing till he question'd it,

  "What art thou?" and the voice about his feet

  Sent up an answer, sobbing, "I am thy fool,

  And I shall never make thee smile again."

Poem 39: Idylls of the King: The Marriage of Geraint

Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;

Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud;

Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

      Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;

With that wild wheel we go not up or down;

Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.

      Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;

Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;

For man is man and master of his fate.


     Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;

Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;

Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

Poem 40: Idylls of the King: The Passing of Arthur (excerpt)

That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,

   First made and latest left of all the knights,

   Told, when the man was no more than a voice

   In the white winter of his age, to those

   With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.

       For on their march to westward, Bedivere,

   Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,

   Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:

       "I found Him in the shining of the stars,

  I mark'd Him in the flowering of His fields,

  But in His ways with men I find Him not.

  I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.

  O me! for why is all around us here

  As if some lesser god had made the world,

  But had not force to shape it as he would,

  Till the High God behold it from beyond,

  And enter it, and make it beautiful?

  Or else as if the world were wholly fair,

  But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,

  And have not power to see it as it is:

  Perchance, because we see not to the close;--

  For I, being simple, thought to work His will,

  And have but stricken with the sword in vain;

  And all whereon I lean'd in wife and friend

  Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm

  Reels back into the beast, and is no more.

  My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death:

  Nay--God my Christ--I pass but shall not die."


      Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,

  There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain kill'd

  In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown

  Along a wandering wind, and past his ear

  Went shrilling, "Hollow, hollow all delight!

  Hail, King! to-morrow thou shalt pass away.

  Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.

  And I am blown along a wandering wind,

  And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight."

  And fainter onward, like wild birds that change

  Their season in the night and wail their way

  From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream

  Shrill'd; but in going mingled with dim cries

  Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,

  As of some lonely city sack'd by night,

  When all is lost, and wife and child with wail

  Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and call'd,

  "Who spake? A dream. O light upon the wind,

  Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries

  Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild

  Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?"


      This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:

  "O me, my King, let pass whatever will,

  Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;

  But in their stead thy name and glory cling

  To all high places like a golden cloud

  For ever: but as yet thou shalt not pass.

  Light was Gawain in life, and light in death

  Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;

  And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--

  I hear the steps of Modred in the west,

   And with him many of thy people, and knights

  Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown

  Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.

  Right well in heart they know thee for the King.

  Arise, go forth and conquer as of old."


      Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

  "Far other is this battle in the west

  Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,

  And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,

  Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,

  And shook him thro' the north. Ill doom is mine

  To war against my people and my knights.

  The king who fights his people fights himself.

  And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke

  That strikes them dead is as my death to me.

  Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way

  Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I saw

  One lying in the dust at Almesbury,

  Hath folded in the passes of the world."


      Then rose the King and moved his host by night,

  And ever push'd Sir Modred, league by league,

  Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--

  A land of old upheaven from the abyss

  By fire, to sink into the abyss again;

  Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,

  And the long mountains ended in a coast

  Of ever-shifting sand, and far away

  The phantom circle of a moaning sea.

  There the pursuer could pursue no more,

  And he that fled no further fly the King;

  And there, that day when the great light of heaven

  Burn'd at his lowest in the rolling year,

  On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.

  Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight

  Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.

  A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:

  Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew

  Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold

  With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur fell

  Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.



 For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,

 And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;

 And some had visions out of golden youth,

 And some beheld the faces of old ghosts

 Look in upon the battle; and in the mist

 Was many a noble deed, many a base,

 And chance and craft and strength in single fights,

 And ever and anon with host to host

 Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,

 Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash

 Of battleaxes on shatter'd helms, and shrieks

 After the Christ, of those who falling down

 Look'd up for heaven, and only saw the mist;

 And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,

 Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,

 Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs

 In that close mist, and cryings for the light,

 Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.



    Last, as by some one deathbed after wail

 Of suffering, silence follows, or thro' death

 Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,

 Save for some whisper of the seething seas,

 A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day

 Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came

 A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew

 The mist aside, and with that wind the tide

 Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field

 Of battle: but no man was moving there;

 Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,

 Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave

 Brake in among dead faces, to and fro

 Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down

 Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,

 And shiver'd brands that once had fought with Rome,

 And rolling far along the gloomy shores

 The voice of days of old and days to be.



    Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,

 And whiter than the mist that all day long

 Had held the field of battle was the King:



    "Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,

 And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,

 And beats upon the faces of the dead,

 My dead, as tho' they had not died for me?--

 O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fall'n

 Confusion, till I know not what I am,

 Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.

 Behold, I seem but King among the dead."



    Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere: "My King,

 King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,

 There also will I worship thee as King.

 Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live

 Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought

 The heathen back among us, yonder stands,

 Modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine house."



    Then spake the King: "My house hath been my doom.

 But call not thou this traitor of my house

 Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.

 My house are rather they who sware my vows,

 Yea, even while they brake them, own'd me King.

 And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,

 When all the purport of my throne hath fail'd,

 That quick or dead thou hottest me for King.

 King am I, whatsoever be their cry;

 And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see

 Yet, ere I pass." And uttering this the King

 Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege

 Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword

 Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,

 Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,

 Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.



    So all day long the noise of battle roll'd

 Among the mountains by the winter sea;

 Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,

 Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their lord,

 King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep,

 The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,

 And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,

 A broken chancel with a broken cross,

 That stood on a dark strait of barren land:

 On one side lay the Ocean, and on one

 Lay a great water, and the moon was full.



    Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

 "The sequel of to-day unsolders all

 The goodliest fellowship of famous knights

 Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep

 They sleep--the men I loved. I think that we

 Shall never more, at any future time,

 Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,

 Walking about the gardens and the halls

 Of Camelot, as in the days that were.

 I perish by this people which I made,--

 Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again

 To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,

 I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm

 That without help I cannot last till morn.

 Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,

 Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how

 In those old days, one summer noon, an arm

 Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,

 Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

 Holding the sword--and how I row'd across

 And took it, and have worn it, like a king;

 And, wheresoever I am sung or told

 In aftertime, this also shall be known:

 But now delay not: take Excalibur,

 And fling him far into the middle mere:

 Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."



    To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:

 "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,

 Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm--

 A little thing may harm a wounded man;

 Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,

 Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."



    So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept,

 And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,

 Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,

 Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang

 Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down

 By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,

 Came on the shining levels of the lake.



    There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,

 And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,

 Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth

 And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:

 For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,

 Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work

 Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long

 That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,

 This way and that dividing the swift mind,

 In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd

 Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd

 There in the many-knotted waterflags,

 That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.

 So strode he back slow to the wounded King.



    Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

 "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?

 What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"



    And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

 "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,

 And the wild water lapping on the crag."



    To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:

 "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,

 Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd

 Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:

 For surer sign had follow'd, either hand

 Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.

 This is a shameful thing for men to lie.

 Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,

 As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing

 I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."



    Then went Sir Bedivere the second time

 Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,

 Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;

 But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,

 How curiously and strangely chased, he smote

 His palms together, and he cried aloud:



    "And if indeed I cast the brand away,

 Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,

 Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,

 Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.

 What good should follow this, if this were done?

 What harm, undone? Deep harm to disobey,

 Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.

 Were it well to obey then, if a king demand

 An act unprofitable, against himself?

 The King is sick, and knows not what he does.

 What record, or what relic of my lord

 Should be to aftertime, but empty breath

 And rumours of a doubt? But were this kept,

 Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,

 Some one might show it at a joust of arms,

 Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,

 Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.

 Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps

 Upon the hidden bases of the hills.'

 So might some old man speak in the aftertime

 To all the people, winning reverence.

 But now much honour and much fame were lost."



    So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,

 And hid Excalibur the second time,

 And so strode back slow to the wounded King.



    Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:

 "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'



    And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

 "I heard the water lapping on the crag,

 And the long ripple washing in the reeds."



    To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:

 "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,

 Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!

 Authority forgets a dying king,

 Laid widow'd of the power in his eye

 That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,

 For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,

 In whom should meet the offices of all,

 Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;

 Either from lust of gold, or like a girl

 Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.

 Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,

 And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:

 But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,

 I will arise and slay thee with my hands."



    Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,

 And, leaping down the ridges, lightly, plunged

 Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword,

 And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand

 Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,

 And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,

 Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,

 Seen where the moving isles of winter shock

 By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.

 So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:

 But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm

 Clothed in white samite, mystic wonderful,

 And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him

 Three times, and drew him under in the mere.

 And lightly went the other to the King.



    Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:

 "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.

 Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"



    And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

 "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems

 Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,

 Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,

 Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,

 So great a miracle as yonder hilt.

 Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;

 But when I look'd again, behold an arm,

 Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

 That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him

 Three times, and drew him under in the mere."



    And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:

 "My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.

 Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,

 And bear me to the margin; yet I fear

 My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."



    So saying, from the pavement he half rose,

 Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,

 And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes

 As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere

 Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,

 And would have spoken, but he found not words;

 Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,

 O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,

 And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.



    But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,

 Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed

 When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,

 Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick!

 I fear it is too late, and I shall die."

 But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,

 Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,

 Larger than human on the frozen hills.

 He heard the deep behind him, and a cry

 Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.

 Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves

 And barren chasms, and all to left and right

 The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based

 His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang

 Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--

 And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,

 And the long glories of the winter moon.



    Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,

 Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,

 Beneath them; and descending they were ware

 That all the decks were dense with stately forms,

 Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these

 Three Queens with crowns of gold: and from them rose

 A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,

 And, as it were one voice, an agony

 Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills

 All night in a waste land, where no one comes,

 Or hath come, since the making of the world.



    Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge."

 So to the barge they came. There those three Queens

 Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.

 But she, that rose the tallest of them all

 And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,

 And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,

 And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,

 And dropping bitter tears against a brow

 Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white

 And colourless, and like the wither'd moon

 Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;

 And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops

 Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--

 That made his forehead like a rising sun

 High from the daïs-throne--were parch'd with dust

 Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,

 Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.

 So like a shatter'd column lay the King;

 Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,

 From spur to plume a star of tournament,

 Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged

 Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.



    Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:

 "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?

 Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?

 For now I see the true old times are dead,

 When every morning brought a noble chance,

 And every chance brought out a noble knight.

 Such times have been not since the light that led

 The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.

 But now the whole Round Table is dissolved

 Which was an image of the mighty world,

 And I, the last, go forth companionless,

 And the days darken round me, and the years,

 Among new men, strange faces, other minds."



    And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:

 "The old order changeth, yielding place to new,

 And God fulfils himself in many ways,

 Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.

 Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?

 I have lived my life, and that which I have done

 May He within himself make pure! but thou,

 If thou shouldst never see my face again,

 Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer

 Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice

 Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

 For what are men better than sheep or goats

 That nourish a blind life within the brain,

 If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer

 Both for themselves and those who call them friend?

 For so the whole round earth is every way

 Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

 But now farewell. I am going a long way

 With these thou seëst--if indeed I go

 (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--

 To the island-valley of Avilion;

 Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,

 Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies

 Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns

 And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,

 Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."



    So said he, and the barge with oar and sail

 Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan

 That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,

 Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood

 With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere

 Revolving many memories, till the hull

 Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,

 And on the mere the wailing died away.



    But when that moan had past for evermore,

 The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn

 Amazed him, and he groan'd, ``The King is gone.''

 And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,

 "From the great deep to the great deep he goes."



    Whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly clomb

 The last hard footstep of that iron crag;

 Thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and cried,

 "He passes to be King among the dead,

 And after healing of his grievous wound

 He comes again; but--if he come no more--

 O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,

 Who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we gazed

 On that high day, when, clothed with living light,

 They stood before his throne in silence, friends

 Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?"



    Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint

 As from beyond the limit of the world,

 Like the last echo born of a great cry,

 Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice

 Around a king returning from his wars.



    Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb

 Ev'n to the highest he could climb, and saw,

 Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,

 Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,

 Down that long water opening on the deep

 Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go

 From less to less and vanish into light.

 And the new sun rose bringing the new year.

Poem 41: In Memoriam 131: O Living Will That Shalt Endure

O living will that shalt endure

When all that seems shall suffer shock,

Rise in the spiritual rock,

Flow thro' our deeds and make them pure,


That we may lift from out of dust

A voice as unto him that hears,

A cry above the conquer'd years

To one that with us works, and trust,


With faith that comes of self-control,

The truths that never can be proved

Until we close with all we loved,

And all we flow from, soul in soul.


O true and tried, so well and long,

Demand not thou a marriage lay;

In that it is thy marriage day

Is music more than any song.


Nor have I felt so much of bliss

Since first he told me that he loved

A daughter of our house; nor proved

Since that dark day a day like this;


Tho' I since then have number'd o'er

Some thrice three years: they went and came,

Remade the blood and changed the frame,

And yet is love not less, but more;


No longer caring to embalm

In dying songs a dead regret,

But like a statue solid-set,

And moulded in colossal calm.


Regret is dead, but love is more

Than in the summers that are flown,

For I myself with these have grown

To something greater than before;


Which makes appear the songs I made

As echoes out of weaker times,

As half but idle brawling rhymes,

The sport of random sun and shade.


But where is she, the bridal flower,

That must be made a wife ere noon?

She enters, glowing like the moon

Of Eden on its bridal bower:


On me she bends her blissful eyes

And then on thee; they meet thy look

And brighten like the star that shook

Betwixt the palms of paradise.


O when her life was yet in bud,

He too foretold the perfect rose.

For thee she grew, for thee she grows

For ever, and as fair as good.


And thou art worthy; full of power;

As gentle; liberal-minded, great,

Consistent; wearing all that weight

Of learning lightly like a flower.


But now set out: the noon is near,

And I must give away the bride;

She fears not, or with thee beside

And me behind her, will not fear.


For I that danced her on my knee,

That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,

That shielded all her life from harm

At last must part with her to thee;


Now waiting to be made a wife,

Her feet, my darling, on the dead;

Their pensive tablets round her head,

And the most living words of life


Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,

The "wilt thou" answer'd, and again

The "wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain

Her sweet "I will" has made you one.


Now sign your names, which shall be read,

Mute symbols of a joyful morn,

By village eyes as yet unborn;

The names are sign'd, and overhead


Begins the clash and clang that tells

The joy to every wandering breeze;

The blind wall rocks, and on the trees

The dead leaf trembles to the bells.


O happy hour, and happier hours

Await them. Many a merry face

Salutes them--maidens of the place,

That pelt us in the porch with flowers.


O happy hour, behold the bride

With him to whom her hand I gave.

They leave the porch, they pass the grave

That has to-day its sunny side.


To-day the grave is bright for me,

For them the light of life increased,

Who stay to share the morning feast,

Who rest to-night beside the sea.


Let all my genial spirits advance

To meet and greet a whiter sun;

My drooping memory will not shun

The foaming grape of eastern France.


It circles round, and fancy plays,

And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,

As drinking health to bride and groom

We wish them store of happy days.


Nor count me all to blame if I

Conjecture of a stiller guest,

Perchance, perchance, among the rest,

And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.


But they must go, the time draws on,

And those white-favour'd horses wait;

They rise, but linger; it is late;

Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.


A shade falls on us like the dark

From little cloudlets on the grass,

But sweeps away as out we pass

To range the woods, to roam the park,


Discussing how their courtship grew,

And talk of others that are wed,

And how she look'd, and what he said,

And back we come at fall of dew.


Again the feast, the speech, the glee,

The shade of passing thought, the wealth

Of words and wit, the double health,

The crowning cup, the three-times-three,


And last the dance,--till I retire:

Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,

And high in heaven the streaming cloud,

And on the downs a rising fire:


And rise, O moon, from yonder down,

Till over down and over dale

All night the shining vapour sail

And pass the silent-lighted town,


The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,

And catch at every mountain head,

And o'er the friths that branch and spread

Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;


And touch with shade the bridal doors,

With tender gloom the roof, the wall;

And breaking let the splendour fall

To spangle all the happy shores


By which they rest, and ocean sounds,

And, star and system rolling past,

A soul shall draw from out the vast

And strike his being into bounds,


And, moved thro' life of lower phase,

Result in man, be born and think,

And act and love, a closer link

Betwixt us and the crowning race


Of those that, eye to eye, shall look

On knowledge; under whose command

Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand

Is Nature like an open book;


No longer half-akin to brute,

For all we thought and loved and did,

And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed

Of what in them is flower and fruit;


Whereof the man, that with me trod

This planet, was a noble type

Appearing ere the times were ripe,

That friend of mine who lives in God,


That God, which ever lives and loves,

One God, one law, one element,

And one far-off divine event,

To which the whole creation moves.

Poem 42: In Memoriam 16: I envy not in any moods

I envy not in any moods

The captive void of noble rage,

The linnet born within the cage,

That never knew the summer woods:


I envy not the beast that takes

His license in the field of time,

Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,

To whom a conscience never wakes;


Nor, what may count itself as blest,

The heart that never plighted troth

But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;

Nor any want-begotten rest.


I hold it true, whate'er befall;

I feel it, when I sorrow most;

'Tis better to have loved and lost

Than never to have loved at all.

Poem 43: In Memoriam 3: O Sorrow, Cruel Fellowship

O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,

O Priestess in the vaults of Death,

O sweet and bitter in a breath,

What whispers from thy lying lip?


"The stars," she whispers, "blindly run;

A web is wov'n across the sky;

From out waste places comes a cry,

And murmurs from the dying sun:


"And all the phantom, Nature, stands--

With all the music in her tone,

A hollow echo of my own,--

A hollow form with empty hands."


And shall I take a thing so blind,

Embrace her as my natural good;

Or crush her, like a vice of blood,

Upon the threshold of the mind?

Poem 44: In Memoriam 82: I Wage Not Any Feud With Death

I wage not any feud with Death

For changes wrought on form and face;

No lower life that earth's embrace

May breed with him, can fright my faith.


Eternal process moving on,

From state to state the spirit walks;

And these are but the shatter'd stalks,

Or ruin'd chrysalis of one.


Nor blame I Death, because he bare

The use of virtue out of earth:

I know transplanted human worth

Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.


For this alone on Death I wreak

The wrath that garners in my heart;

He put our lives so far apart

We cannot hear each other speak.

Poem 45: In Memoriam A. H. H.

OBIIT

MDCCCXXXIII

[Preface]

  Strong Son of God, immortal Love,

    Whom we, that have not seen thy face,

    By faith, and faith alone, embrace,

  Believing where we cannot prove;

  Thine are these orbs of light and shade;

    Thou madest Life in man and brute;

    Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot

  Is on the skull which thou hast made.

  Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:

   Thou madest man, he knows not why,

   He thinks he was not made to die;

 And thou hast made him: thou art just.


 Thou seemest human and divine,

   The highest, holiest manhood, thou.

   Our wills are ours, we know not how;

 Our wills are ours, to make them thine.


 Our little systems have their day;

   They have their day and cease to be:

   They are but broken lights of thee,

 And thou, O Lord, art more than they.


 We have but faith: we cannot know;

   For knowledge is of things we see;

   And yet we trust it comes from thee,

 A beam in darkness: let it grow.


 Let knowledge grow from more to more,

   But more of reverence in us dwell;

   That mind and soul, according well,

 May make one music as before,


 But vaster. We are fools and slight;

   We mock thee when we do not fear:

   But help thy foolish ones to bear;

 Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.


 Forgive what seem'd my sin in me;

   What seem'd my worth since I began;

   For merit lives from man to man,

 And not from man, O Lord, to thee.


 Forgive my grief for one removed,

   Thy creature, whom I found so fair.

   I trust he lives in thee, and there

 I find him worthier to be loved.


 Forgive these wild and wandering cries,

   Confusions of a wasted youth;

   Forgive them where they fail in truth,

 And in thy wisdom make me wise.

                                  1849.


I

  I held it truth, with him who sings

    To one clear harp in divers tones,

    That men may rise on stepping-stones

  Of their dead selves to higher things.

  But who shall so forecast the years

    And find in loss a gain to match?

    Or reach a hand thro' time to catch

  The far-off interest of tears?

  Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd,

   Let darkness keep her raven gloss:

   Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss,

 To dance with death, to beat the ground,


 Than that the victor Hours should scorn

   The long result of love, and boast,

   `Behold the man that loved and lost,

 But all he was is overworn.'

II

  Old Yew, which graspest at the stones

    That name the under-lying dead,

    Thy fibres net the dreamless head,

  Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.

  The seasons bring the flower again,

    And bring the firstling to the flock;

    And in the dusk of thee, the clock

  Beats out the little lives of men.

  O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,

   Who changest not in any gale,

   Nor branding summer suns avail

 To touch thy thousand years of gloom:


 And gazing on thee, sullen tree,

   Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,

   I seem to fail from out my blood

 And grow incorporate into thee.

III

  O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,

    O Priestess in the vaults of Death,

    O sweet and bitter in a breath,

  What whispers from thy lying lip?

  `The stars,' she whispers, `blindly run;

    A web is wov'n across the sky;

    From out waste places comes a cry,

  And murmurs from the dying sun:

  "And all the phantom, Nature, stands --

   With all the music in her tone,

   A hollow echo of my own, --

 A hollow form with empty hands."


 And shall I take a thing so blind,

   Embrace her as my natural good;

   Or crush her, like a vice of blood,

 Upon the threshold of the mind?

IV

  To Sleep I give my powers away;

    My will is bondsman to the dark;

    I sit within a helmless bark,

  And with my heart I muse and say:

  O heart, how fares it with thee now,

    That thou should'st fail from thy desire,

    Who scarcely darest to inquire,

  "What is it makes me beat so low?"

  Something it is which thou hast lost,

   Some pleasure from thine early years.

   Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears,

 That grief hath shaken into frost!


 Such clouds of nameless trouble cross

   All night below the darken'd eyes;

   With morning wakes the will, and cries,

 "Thou shalt not be the fool of loss."

V

  I sometimes hold it half a sin

    To put in words the grief I feel;

    For words, like Nature, half reveal

  And half conceal the Soul within.

  But, for the unquiet heart and brain,

    A use in measured language lies;

    The sad mechanic exercise,

  Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.

  In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,

   Like coarsest clothes against the cold:

   But that large grief which these enfold

 Is given in outline and no more.

VI

  One writes, that `Other friends remain,'

    That `Loss is common to the race' --

    And common is the commonplace,

  And vacant chaff well meant for grain.

  That loss is common would not make

    My own less bitter, rather more:

    Too common! Never morning wore

  To evening, but some heart did break.

  O father, wheresoe'er thou be,

   Who pledgest now thy gallant son;

   A shot, ere half thy draught be done,

 Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.


 O mother, praying God will save

   Thy sailor, -- while thy head is bow'd,

   His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud

 Drops in his vast and wandering grave.


 Ye know no more than I who wrought

   At that last hour to please him well;

   Who mused on all I had to tell,

 And something written, something thought;


 Expecting still his advent home;

   And ever met him on his way

   With wishes, thinking, "here to-day,"

 Or "here to-morrow will he come."


 O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,

   That sittest ranging golden hair;

   And glad to find thyself so fair,

 Poor child, that waitest for thy love!


 For now her father's chimney glows

   In expectation of a guest;

   And thinking "this will please him best,"

 She takes a riband or a rose;


 For he will see them on to-night;

   And with the thought her colour burns;

   And, having left the glass, she turns

 Once more to set a ringlet right;


 And, even when she turn'd, the curse

   Had fallen, and her future Lord

   Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,

 Or kill'd in falling from his horse.


 O what to her shall be the end?

   And what to me remains of good?

   To her, perpetual maidenhood,

 And unto me no second friend.

VII

  Dark house, by which once more I stand

    Here in the long unlovely street,

    Doors, where my heart was used to beat

  So quickly, waiting for a hand,

  A hand that can be clasp'd no more --

    Behold me, for I cannot sleep,

    And like a guilty thing I creep

  At earliest morning to the door.

 He is not here; but far away

   The noise of life begins again,

   And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain

 On the bald street breaks the blank day.

VIII

  A happy lover who has come

    To look on her that loves him well,

    Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell,

  And learns her gone and far from home;

  He saddens, all the magic light

    Dies off at once from bower and hall,

    And all the place is dark, and all

  The chambers emptied of delight:

  So find I every pleasant spot

   In which we two were wont to meet,

   The field, the chamber, and the street,

 For all is dark where thou art not.


 Yet as that other, wandering there

   In those deserted walks, may find

   A flower beat with rain and wind,

 Which once she foster'd up with care;


 So seems it in my deep regret,

   O my forsaken heart, with thee

   And this poor flower of poesy

 Which little cared for fades not yet.


 But since it pleased a vanish'd eye,

   I go to plant it on his tomb,

   That if it can it there may bloom,

 Or, dying, there at least may die.

IX

  Fair ship, that from the Italian shore

    Sailest the placid ocean-plains

    With my lost Arthur's loved remains,

  Spread thy full wings, and waft him o'er.

  So draw him home to those that mourn

    In vain; a favourable speed

    Ruffle thy mirror'd mast, and lead

  Thro' prosperous floods his holy urn.

  All night no ruder air perplex

   Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright

   As our pure love, thro' early light

 Shall glimmer on the dewy decks.


 Sphere all your lights around, above;

   Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow;

   Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now,

 My friend, the brother of my love;


 My Arthur, whom I shall not see

   Till all my widow'd race be run;

   Dear as the mother to the son,

 More than my brothers are to me.

X

  I hear the noise about thy keel;

    I hear the bell struck in the night:

    I see the cabin-window bright;

  I see the sailor at the wheel.

  Thou bring'st the sailor to his wife,

    And travell'd men from foreign lands;

    And letters unto trembling hands;

  And, thy dark freight, a vanish'd life.

  So bring him; we have idle dreams:

    This look of quiet flatters thus

    Our home-bred fancies. O to us,

  The fools of habit, sweeter seems


  To rest beneath the clover sod,

    That takes the sunshine and the rains,

    Or where the kneeling hamlet drains

  The chalice of the grapes of God;


  Than if with thee the roaring wells

    Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine;

    And hands so often clasp'd in mine,

  Should toss with tangle and with shells.

XI

  Calm is the morn without a sound,

    Calm as to suit a calmer grief,

    And only thro' the faded leaf

  The chestnut pattering to the ground:

  Calm and deep peace on this high wold,

    And on these dews that drench the furze,

    And all the silvery gossamers

  That twinkle into green and gold:

  Calm and still light on yon great plain

   That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,

   And crowded farms and lessening towers,

 To mingle with the bounding main:


 Calm and deep peace in this wide air,

   These leaves that redden to the fall;

   And in my heart, if calm at all,

 If any calm, a calm despair:


 Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,

   And waves that sway themselves in rest,

   And dead calm in that noble breast

 Which heaves but with the heaving deep.

XII

  Lo, as a dove when up she springs

    To bear thro' Heaven a tale of woe,

    Some dolorous message knit below

  The wild pulsation of her wings;

  Like her I go; I cannot stay;

    I leave this mortal ark behind,

    A weight of nerves without a mind,

  And leave the cliffs, and haste away

  O'er ocean-mirrors rounded large,

   And reach the glow of southern skies,

   And see the sails at distance rise,

 And linger weeping on the marge,


 And saying; `Comes he thus, my friend?

   Is this the end of all my care?'

   And circle moaning in the air:

 `Is this the end? Is this the end?'


 And forward dart again, and play

   About the prow, and back return

   To where the body sits, and learn

 That I have been an hour away.

XIII

  Tears of the widower, when he sees

    A late-lost form that sleep reveals,

    And moves his doubtful arms, and feels

  Her place is empty, fall like these;

  Which weep a loss for ever new,

    A void where heart on heart reposed;

    And, where warm hands have prest and closed,

  Silence, till I be silent too.

  Which weep the comrade of my choice,

   An awful thought, a life removed,

   The human-hearted man I loved,

 A Spirit, not a breathing voice.


 Come, Time, and teach me, many years,

   I do not suffer in a dream;

   For now so strange do these things seem,

 Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;


 My fancies time to rise on wing,

   And glance about the approaching sails,

   As tho' they brought but merchants' bales,

 And not the burthen that they bring.

XIV

  If one should bring me this report,

    That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day,

    And I went down unto the quay,

  And found thee lying in the port;

  And standing, muffled round with woe,

    Should see thy passengers in rank

    Come stepping lightly down the plank,

  And beckoning unto those they know;

  And if along with these should come

   The man I held as half-divine;

   Should strike a sudden hand in mine,

 And ask a thousand things of home;


 And I should tell him all my pain,

   And how my life had droop'd of late,

   And he should sorrow o'er my state

 And marvel what possess'd my brain;


 And I perceived no touch of change,

   No hint of death in all his frame,

   But found him all in all the same,

 I should not feel it to be strange.

XV

  To-night the winds begin to rise

    And roar from yonder dropping day:

    The last red leaf is whirl'd away,

  The rooks are blown about the skies;

  The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,

    The cattle huddled on the lea;

    And wildly dash'd on tower and tree

  The sunbeam strikes along the world:

  And but for fancies, which aver

   That all thy motions gently pass

   Athwart a plane of molten glass,

 I scarce could brook the strain and stir


 That makes the barren branches loud;

   And but for fear it is not so,

   The wild unrest that lives in woe

 Would dote and pore on yonder cloud


 That rises upward always higher,

   And onward drags a labouring breast,

   And topples round the dreary west,

 A looming bastion fringed with fire.

XVI

  What words are these have fall'n from me?

    Can calm despair and wild unrest

    Be tenants of a single breast,

  Or sorrow such a changeling be?

  Or doth she only seem to take

    The touch of change in calm or storm;

    But knows no more of transient form

  In her deep self, than some dead lake

  That holds the shadow of a lark

   Hung in the shadow of a heaven?

   Or has the shock, so harshly given,

 Confused me like the unhappy bark


 That strikes by night a craggy shelf,

   And staggers blindly ere she sink?

   And stunn'd me from my power to think

 And all my knowledge of myself;


 And made me that delirious man

   Whose fancy fuses old and new,

   And flashes into false and true,

 And mingles all without a plan?

XVII

  Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze

    Compell'd thy canvas, and my prayer

    Was as the whisper of an air

  To breathe thee over lonely seas.

  For I in spirit saw thee move

    Thro' circles of the bounding sky,

    Week after week: the days go by:

  Come quick, thou bringest all I love.

  Henceforth, wherever thou may'st roam,

   My blessing, like a line of light,

   Is on the waters day and night,

 And like a beacon guards thee home.


 So may whatever tempest mars

   Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark;

   And balmy drops in summer dark

 Slide from the bosom of the stars.


 So kind an office hath been done,

   Such precious relics brought by thee;

   The dust of him I shall not see

 Till all my widow'd race be run.

XVIII

  'Tis well; 'tis something; we may stand

    Where he in English earth is laid,

    And from his ashes may be made

  The violet of his native land.

  'Tis little; but it looks in truth

    As if the quiet bones were blest

    Among familiar names to rest

  And in the places of his youth.

  Come then, pure hands, and bear the head

   That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,

   And come, whatever loves to weep,

 And hear the ritual of the dead.


 Ah yet, ev'n yet, if this might be,

   I, falling on his faithful heart,

   Would breathing thro' his lips impart

 The life that almost dies in me;


 That dies not, but endures with pain,

   And slowly forms the firmer mind,

   Treasuring the look it cannot find,

 The words that are not heard again.

XIX

  The Danube to the Severn gave

    The darken'd heart that beat no more;

    They laid him by the pleasant shore,

  And in the hearing of the wave.

  There twice a day the Severn fills;

    The salt sea-water passes by,

    And hushes half the babbling Wye,

  And makes a silence in the hills.

  The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,

   And hush'd my deepest grief of all,

   When fill'd with tears that cannot fall,

 I brim with sorrow drowning song.


 The tide flows down, the wave again

   Is vocal in its wooded walls;

   My deeper anguish also falls,

 And I can speak a little then.

XX

  The lesser griefs that may be said,

    That breathe a thousand tender vows,

    Are but as servants in a house

  Where lies the master newly dead;

  Who speak their feeling as it is,

    And weep the fulness from the mind:

    "It will be hard," they say, "to find

  Another service such as this."

  My lighter moods are like to these,

   That out of words a comfort win;

   But there are other griefs within,

 And tears that at their fountain freeze;


 For by the hearth the children sit

   Cold in that atmosphere of Death,

   And scarce endure to draw the breath,

 Or like to noiseless phantoms flit;


 But open converse is there none,

   So much the vital spirits sink

   To see the vacant chair, and think,

 "How good! how kind! and he is gone."

XXI

  I sing to him that rests below,

    And, since the grasses round me wave,

    I take the grasses of the grave,

  And make them pipes whereon to blow.

  The traveller hears me now and then,

    And sometimes harshly will he speak:

    "This fellow would make weakness weak,

  And melt the waxen hearts of men."

  Another answers, `Let him be,

   He loves to make parade of pain

   That with his piping he may gain

 The praise that comes to constancy.'


 A third is wroth: "Is this an hour

   For private sorrow's barren song,

   When more and more the people throng

 The chairs and thrones of civil power?


 "A time to sicken and to swoon,

   When Science reaches forth her arms

   To feel from world to world, and charms

 Her secret from the latest moon?"


 Behold, ye speak an idle thing:

   Ye never knew the sacred dust:

   I do but sing because I must,

 And pipe but as the linnets sing:


 And one is glad; her note is gay,

   For now her little ones have ranged;

   And one is sad; her note is changed,

 Because her brood is stol'n away.

XXII

  The path by which we twain did go,

    Which led by tracts that pleased us well,

    Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,

  From flower to flower, from snow to snow:

  And we with singing cheer'd the way,

    And, crown'd with all the season lent,

    From April on to April went,

  And glad at heart from May to May:

  But where the path we walk'd began

   To slant the fifth autumnal slope,

   As we descended following Hope,

 There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;


 Who broke our fair companionship,

   And spread his mantle dark and cold,

   And wrapt thee formless in the fold,

 And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,


 And bore thee where I could not see

   Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,

   And think, that somewhere in the waste

 The Shadow sits and waits for me.

XXIII

  Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,

    Or breaking into song by fits,

    Alone, alone, to where he sits,

  The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,

  Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,

    I wander, often falling lame,

    And looking back to whence I came,

  Or on to where the pathway leads;

  And crying, How changed from where it ran

   Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;

   But all the lavish hills would hum

 The murmur of a happy Pan:


 When each by turns was guide to each,

   And Fancy light from Fancy caught,

   And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought

 Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;


 And all we met was fair and good,

   And all was good that Time could bring,

   And all the secret of the Spring

 Moved in the chambers of the blood;


 And many an old philosophy

   On Argive heights divinely sang,

   And round us all the thicket rang

 To many a flute of Arcady.

XXIV

  And was the day of my delight

    As pure and perfect as I say?

    The very source and fount of Day

  Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.

  If all was good and fair we met,

    This earth had been the Paradise

    It never look'd to human eyes

  Since our first Sun arose and set.

  And is it that the haze of grief

   Makes former gladness loom so great?

   The lowness of the present state,

 That sets the past in this relief?


 Or that the past will always win

   A glory from its being far;

   And orb into the perfect star

 We saw not, when we moved therein?

XXV

  I know that this was Life, -- the track

    Whereon with equal feet we fared;

    And then, as now, the day prepared

  The daily burden for the back.

  But this it was that made me move

    As light as carrier-birds in air;

    I loved the weight I had to bear,

  Because it needed help of Love:

  Nor could I weary, heart or limb,

   When mighty Love would cleave in twain

   The lading of a single pain,

 And part it, giving half to him.

XXVI

  Still onward winds the dreary way;

    I with it; for I long to prove

    No lapse of moons can canker Love,

  Whatever fickle tongues may say.

  And if that eye which watches guilt

    And goodness, and hath power to see

    Within the green the moulder'd tree,

  And towers fall'n as soon as built --

  Oh, if indeed that eye foresee

   Or see (in Him is no before)

   In more of life true life no more

 And Love the indifference to be,


 Then might I find, ere yet the morn

   Breaks hither over Indian seas,

   That Shadow waiting with the keys,

 To shroud me from my proper scorn.

XXVII

  I envy not in any moods

    The captive void of noble rage,

    The linnet born within the cage,

  That never knew the summer woods:

  I envy not the beast that takes

    His license in the field of time,

    Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,

  To whom a conscience never wakes;

  Nor, what may count itself as blest,

   The heart that never plighted troth

   But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;

 Nor any want-begotten rest.


 I hold it true, whate'er befall;

   I feel it, when I sorrow most;

   'Tis better to have loved and lost

 Than never to have loved at all.

XXVIII

  The time draws near the birth of Christ:

    The moon is hid; the night is still;

    The Christmas bells from hill to hill

  Answer each other in the mist.

  Four voices of four hamlets round,

    From far and near, on mead and moor,

    Swell out and fail, as if a door

  Were shut between me and the sound:

  Each voice four changes on the wind,

   That now dilate, and now decrease,

   Peace and goodwill, goodwill and peace,

 Peace and goodwill, to all mankind.


 This year I slept and woke with pain,

   I almost wish'd no more to wake,

   And that my hold on life would break

 Before I heard those bells again:


 But they my troubled spirit rule,

   For they controll'd me when a boy;

   They bring me sorrow touch'd with joy,

 The merry merry bells of Yule.

XXIX

  With such compelling cause to grieve

    As daily vexes household peace,

    And chains regret to his decease,

  How dare we keep our Christmas-eve;

  Which brings no more a welcome guest

    To enrich the threshold of the night

    With shower'd largess of delight

  In dance and song and game and jest?

  Yet go, and while the holly boughs

   Entwine the cold baptismal font,

   Make one wreath more for Use and Wont,

 That guard the portals of the house;


 Old sisters of a day gone by,

   Gray nurses, loving nothing new;

   Why should they miss their yearly due

 Before their time? They too will die.

XXX

  With trembling fingers did we weave

    The holly round the Chrismas hearth;

    A rainy cloud possess'd the earth,

  And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.

  At our old pastimes in the hall

    We gambol'd, making vain pretence

    Of gladness, with an awful sense

  Of one mute Shadow watching all.

  We paused: the winds were in the beech:br>


   We heard them sweep the winter land;br>


   And in a circle hand-in-hand

 Sat silent, looking each at each.


 Then echo-like our voices rang;

   We sung, tho' every eye was dim,

   A merry song we sang with him

 Last year: impetuously we sang:


 We ceased: a gentler feeling crept

   Upon us: surely rest is meet:

   "They rest," we said, "their sleep is sweet,"

 And silence follow'd, and we wept.


 Our voices took a higher range;

   Once more we sang: "They do not die

   Nor lose their mortal sympathy,

 Nor change to us, although they change;


 "Rapt from the fickle and the frail

   With gather'd power, yet the same,

   Pierces the keen seraphic flame

 From orb to orb, from veil to veil."


 Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,

   Draw forth the cheerful day from night:

   O Father, touch the east, and light

 The light that shone when Hope was born.

XXXI

  When Lazarus left his charnel-cave,

    And home to Mary's house return'd,

    Was this demanded -- if he yearn'd

  To hear her weeping by his grave?

  "Where wert thou, brother, those four days?"

    There lives no record of reply,

    Which telling what it is to die

  Had surely added praise to praise.

  From every house the neighbours met,

   The streets were fill'd with joyful sound,

   A solemn gladness even crown'd

 The purple brows of Olivet.


 Behold a man raised up by Christ!

   The rest remaineth unreveal'd;

   He told it not; or something seal'd

 The lips of that Evangelist.

XXXII

  Her eyes are homes of silent prayer,

    Nor other thought her mind admits

    But, he was dead, and there he sits,

  And he that brought him back is there.

  Then one deep love doth supersede

    All other, when her ardent gaze

    Roves from the living brother's face,

  And rests upon the Life indeed.

  All subtle thought, all curious fears,

   Borne down by gladness so complete,

   She bows, she bathes the Saviour's feet

 With costly spikenard and with tears.


 Thrice blest whose lives are faithful prayers,

   Whose loves in higher love endure;

   What souls possess themselves so pure,

 Or is there blessedness like theirs?

XXXIII

  O thou that after toil and storm

    Mayst seem to have reach'd a purer air,

    Whose faith has centre everywhere,

  Nor cares to fix itself to form,

  Leave thou thy sister when she prays,

    Her early Heaven, her happy views;

    Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse

  A life that leads melodious days.

  Her faith thro' form is pure as thine,

   Her hands are quicker unto good:

   Oh, sacred be the flesh and blood

 To which she links a truth divine!


 See thou, that countess reason ripe

   In holding by the law within,

   Thou fail not in a world of sin,

 And ev'n for want of such a type.

XXXIV

  My own dim life should teach me this,

    That life shall live for evermore,

    Else earth is darkness at the core,

  And dust and ashes all that is;

  This round of green, this orb of flame,

    Fantastic beauty; such as lurks

    In some wild Poet, when he works

  Without a conscience or an aim.

  What then were God to such as I?

   'Twere hardly worth my while to choose

   Of things all mortal, or to use

 A tattle patience ere I die;


 'Twere best at once to sink to peace,

   Like birds the charming serpent draws,

   To drop head-foremost in the jaws

 Of vacant darkness and to cease.

XXXV

  Yet if some voice that man could trust

    Should murmur from the narrow house,

    `The cheeks drop in; the body bows;

  Man dies: nor is there hope in dust:'

  Might I not say? "Yet even here,

    But for one hour, O Love, I strive

    To keep so sweet a thing alive."

  But I should turn mine ears and hear

  The moanings of the homeless sea,

   The sound of streams that swift or slow

   Draw down Æonian hills, and sow

 The dust of continents to be;


 And Love would answer with a sigh,

   "The sound of that forgetful shore

   Will change my sweetness more and more,

 Half-dead to know that I shall die."


 O me, what profits it to put

   An idle case? If Death were seen

   At first as Death, Love had not been,

 Or been in narrowest working shut,


 Mere fellowship of sluggish moods,

   Or in his coarsest Satyr-shape

   Had bruised the herb and crush'd the grape,

 And bask'd and batten'd in the woods.

XXXVI

  Tho' truths in manhood darkly join,

    Deep-seated in our mystic frame,

    We yield all blessing to the name

  Of Him that made them current coin;

  For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers,

    Where truth in closest words shall fail,

    When truth embodied in a tale

  Shall enter in at lowly doors.

  And so the Word had breath, and wrought

   With human hands the creed of creeds

   In loveliness of perfect deeds,

 More strong than all poetic thought;


 Which he may read that binds the sheaf,

   Or builds the house, or digs the grave,

   And those wild eyes that watch the wave

 In roarings round the coral reef.

XXXVII

  Urania speaks with darken'd brow:

    `Thou pratest here where thou art least;

    This faith has many a purer priest,

  And many an abler voice than thou.

  `Go down beside thy native rill,

    On thy Parnassus set thy feet,

    And hear thy laurel whisper sweet

  About the ledges of the hill.'

  And my Melpomene replies,

   A touch of shame upon her cheek:

   `I am not worthy ev'n to speak

 Of thy prevailing mysteries;


 `For I am but an earthly Muse,

   And owning but a little art

  To lull with song an aching heart,

 And render human love his dues;


 "But brooding on the dear one dead,

   And all he said of things divine,

   (And dear to me as sacred wine

 To dying lips is all he said),


 "I murmur'd, as I came along,

   Of comfort clasp'd in truth reveal'd;

   And loiter'd in the master's field,

 And darken'd sanctities with song."

XXXVIII

  With weary steps I loiter on,

    Tho' always under alter'd skies

    The purple from the distance dies,

  My prospect and horizon gone.

  No joy the blowing season gives,

    The herald melodies of spring,

    But in the songs I love to sing

  A doubtful gleam of solace lives.

  If any care for what is here

   Survive in spirits render'd free,

   Then are these songs I sing of thee

 Not all ungrateful to thine ear.XXXIX

  Old warder of these buried bones,

    And answering now my random stroke

    With fruitful cloud and living smoke,

  Dark yew, that graspest at the stones

  And dippest toward the dreamless head,

    To thee too comes the golden hour

    When flower is feeling after flower;

  But Sorrow -- fixt upon the dead,

  And darkening the dark graves of men, --  

   What whisper'd from her lying lips?

   Thy gloom is kindled at the tips,

 And passes into gloom again.

XL

  Could we forget the widow'd hour

    And look on Spirits breathed away,

    As on a maiden in the day

  When first she wears her orange-flower!

  When crown'd with blessing she doth rise

    To take her latest leave of home,

    And hopes and light regrets that come

  Make April of her tender eyes;

  And doubtful joys the father move,

   And tears are on the mother's face,

   As parting with a long embrace

 She enters other realms of love;


 Her office there to rear, to teach,

   Becoming as is meet and fit

   A link among the days, to knit

 The generations each with each;


 And, doubtless, unto thee is given

   A life that bears immortal fruit

   In those great offices that suit

 The full-grown energies of heaven.


 Ay me, the difference I discern!

   How often shall her old fireside

   Be cheer'd with tidings of the bride,

 How often she herself return,


 And tell them all they would have told,

   And bring her babe, and make her boast,

   Till even those that miss'd her most

 Shall count new things as dear as old:


 But thou and I have shaken hands,

   Till growing winters lay me low;

   My paths are in the fields I know.

 And thine in undiscover'd lands.

XLI

  Thy spirit ere our fatal loss

    Did ever rise from high to higher;

    As mounts the heavenward altar-fire,

  As flies the lighter thro' the gross.

  But thou art turn'd to something strange,

    And I have lost the links that bound

    Thy changes; here upon the ground,

  No more partaker of thy change.

  Deep folly! yet that this could be --

   That I could wing my will with might

   To leap the grades of life and light,

 And flash at once, my friend, to thee.


 For tho' my nature rarely yields

   To that vague fear implied in death;

   Nor shudders at the gulfs beneath,

 The howlings from forgotten fields;


 Yet oft when sundown skirts the moor

   An inner trouble I behold,

   A spectral doubt which makes me cold,

 That I shall be thy mate no more,


 Tho' following with an upward mind

   The wonders that have come to thee,

   Thro' all the secular to-be,

 But evermore a life behind.

XLII

  I vex my heart with fancies dim:

    He still outstript me in the race;

    It was but unity of place

  That made me dream I rank'd with him.

  And so may Place retain us still,

    And he the much-beloved again,

    A lord of large experience, train

  To riper growth the mind and will:

  And what delights can equal those

   That stir the spirit's inner deeps,

   When one that loves but knows not, reaps

 A truth from one that loves and knows?

XLIII

  If Sleep and Death be truly one,

    And every spirit's folded bloom

    Thro' all its intervital gloom

  In some long trance should slumber on;

  Unconscious of the sliding hour,

    Bare of the body, might it last,

    And silent traces of the past

  Be all the colour of the flower:

  So then were nothing lost to man;

   So that still garden of the souls

   In many a figured leaf enrolls

 The total world since life began;


 And love will last as pure and whole

   As when he loved me here in Time,

   And at the spiritual prime

 Rewaken with the dawning soul.

XLIV

  How fares it with the happy dead?

    For here the man is more and more;

    But he forgets the days before

  God shut the doorways of his head.

  The days have vanish'd, tone and tint,

    And yet perhaps the hoarding sense

    Gives out at times (he knows not whence)

  A little flash, a mystic hint;

  And in the long harmonious years

   (If Death so taste Lethean springs),

   May some dim touch of earthly things

 Surprise thee ranging with thy peers.


 If such a dreamy touch should fall,

   O, turn thee round, resolve the doubt;

  My guardian angel will speak out

 In that high place, and tell thee all.

XLV

  The baby new to earth and sky,

    What time his tender palm is prest

    Against the circle of the breast,

  Has never thought that "this is I:"

  But as he grows he gathers much,

    And learns the use of "I," and "me,"

    And finds "I am not what I see,

  And other than the things I touch."

  So rounds he to a separate mind

   From whence clear memory may begin,

   As thro' the frame that binds him in

 His isolation grows defined.


 This use may lie in blood and breath,

   Which else were fruitless of their due,

   Had man to learn himself anew

 Beyond the second birth of Death.

XLVI

  We ranging down this lower track,

    The path we came by, thorn and flower,

    Is shadow'd by the growing hour,

  Lest life should fail in looking back.

  So be it: there no shade can last

    In that deep dawn behind the tomb,

    But clear from marge to marge shall bloom

  The eternal landscape of the past;

  A lifelong tract of time reveal'd;

   The fruitful hours of still increase;

   Days order'd in a wealthy peace,

 And those five years its richest field.


 O Love, thy province were not large,

   A bounded field, nor stretching far;

   Look also, Love, a brooding star,

 A rosy warmth from marge to marge.

XLVII

  That each, who seems a separate whole,

    Should move his rounds, and fusing all

    The skirts of self again, should fall

  Remerging in the general Soul,

  Is faith as vague as all unsweet:

    Eternal form shall still divide

    The eternal soul from all beside;

  And I shall know him when we meet:

  And we shall sit at endless feast,

   Enjoying each the other's good:

   What vaster dream can hit the mood

 Of Love on earth? He seeks at least


 Upon the last and sharpest height,

   Before the spirits fade away,

   Some landing-place, to clasp and say,

 "Farewell! We lose ourselves in light."

XLVIII

  If these brief lays, of Sorrow born,

    Were taken to be such as closed

    Grave doubts and answers here proposed,

  Then these were such as men might scorn:

  Her care is not to part and prove;

    She takes, when harsher moods remit,

    What slender shade of doubt may flit,

  And makes it vassal unto love:

  And hence, indeed, she sports with words,

   But better serves a wholesome law,

   And holds it sin and shame to draw

 The deepest measure from the chords:


 Nor dare she trust a larger lay,

   But rather loosens from the lip

   Short swallow-flights of song, that dip

 Their wings in tears, and skim away.

XLIX

  From art, from nature, from the schools,

    Let random influences glance,

    Like light in many a shiver'd lance

  That breaks about the dappled pools:

  The lightest wave of thought shall lisp,

    The fancy's tenderest eddy wreathe,

    The slightest air of song shall breathe

  To make the sullen surface crisp.

  And look thy look, and go thy way,

   But blame not thou the winds that make

   The seeming-wanton ripple break,

 The tender-pencil'd shadow play.


 Beneath all fancied hopes and fears

   Ay me, the sorrow deepens down,

   Whose muffled motions blindly drown

 The bases of my life in tears.

L

  Be near me when my light is low,

    When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick

    And tingle; and the heart is sick,

  And all the wheels of Being slow.

  Be near me when the sensuous frame

    Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust;

    And Time, a maniac scattering dust,

  And Life, a Fury slinging flame.

  Be near me when my faith is dry,

   And men the flies of latter spring,

   That lay their eggs, and sting and sing

 And weave their petty cells and die.


 Be near me when I fade away,

   To point the term of human strife,

   And on the low dark verge of life

 The twilight of eternal day.

LI

  Do we indeed desire the dead

    Should still be near us at our side?

    Is there no baseness we would hide?

  No inner vileness that we dread?

  Shall he for whose applause I strove,

    I had such reverence for his blame,

    See with clear eye some hidden shame

  And I be lessen'd in his love?

  I wrong the grave with fears untrue:

   Shall love be blamed for want of faith?

   There must be wisdom with great Death:

 The dead shall look me thro' and thro'.


 Be near us when we climb or fall:

   Ye watch, like God, the rolling hours

   With larger other eyes than ours,

 To make allowance for us all.LII

  I cannot love thee as I ought,

    For love reflects the thing beloved;

    My words are only words, and moved

  Upon the topmost froth of thought.

  "Yet blame not thou thy plaintive song,"

    The Spirit of true love replied;

    "Thou canst not move me from thy side,

  Nor human frailty do me wrong.

  "What keeps a spirit wholly true

   To that ideal which he bears?

   What record? not the sinless years

 That breathed beneath the Syrian blue:


 "So fret not, like an idle girl,

   That life is dash'd with flecks of sin.

   Abide: thy wealth is gather'd in,

 When Time hath sunder'd shell from pearl."LIII

  How many a father have I seen,

    A sober man, among his boys,

    Whose youth was full of foolish noise,

  Who wears his manhood hale and green:

  And dare we to this fancy give,

    That had the wild oat not been sown,

    The soil, left barren, scarce had grown

  The grain by which a man may live?

  Or, if we held the doctrine sound

   For life outliving heats of youth,

   Yet who would preach it as a truth

 To those that eddy round and round?


 Hold thou the good: define it well:

   For fear divine Philosophy

   Should push beyond her mark, and be

 Procuress to the Lords of Hell.LIV

  Oh, yet we trust that somehow good

    Will be the final goal of ill,

    To pangs of nature, sins of will,

  Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;

  That nothing walks with aimless feet;

    That not one life shall be destroy'd,

    Or cast as rubbish to the void,

  When God hath made the pile complete;

  That not a worm is cloven in vain;

   That not a moth with vain desire

   Is shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,

 Or but subserves another's gain.


 Behold, we know not anything;

   I can but trust that good shall fall

   At last -- far off -- at last, to all,

 And every winter change to spring.


 So runs my dream: but what am I?

   An infant crying in the night:

   An infant crying for the light:

 And with no language but a cry.LV

  The wish, that of the living whole

    No life may fail beyond the grave,

    Derives it not from what we have

  The likest God within the soul?

  Are God and Nature then at strife,

    That Nature lends such evil dreams?

    So careful of the type she seems,

  So careless of the single life;

  That I, considering everywhere

   Her secret meaning in her deeds,

   And finding that of fifty seeds

 She often brings but one to bear,


 I falter where I firmly trod,

   And falling with my weight of cares

   Upon the great world's altar-stairs

 That slope thro' darkness up to God,


 I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,

   And gather dust and chaff, and call

   To what I feel is Lord of all,

 And faintly trust the larger hope.LVI

  "So careful of the type?" but no.

    From scarped cliff and quarried stone

    She cries, "A thousand types are gone:

  I care for nothing, all shall go.

  "Thou makest thine appeal to me:

    I bring to life, I bring to death:

    The spirit does but mean the breath:

  I know no more." And he, shall he,

  Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,

   Such splendid purpose in his eyes,

   Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,

 Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,


 Who trusted God was love indeed

   And love Creation's final law --

   Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw

 With ravine, shriek'd against his creed --


 Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,

   Who battled for the True, the Just,

   Be blown about the desert dust,

 Or seal'd within the iron hills?


 No more? A monster then, a dream,

   A discord. Dragons of the prime,

   That tare each other in their slime,

 Were mellow music match'd with him.


 O life as futile, then, as frail!

   O for thy voice to soothe and bless!

   What hope of answer, or redress?

 Behind the veil, behind the veil.LVII

  Peace; come away: the song of woe

    Is after all an earthly song:

    Peace; come away: we do him wrong

  To sing so wildly: let us go.

  Come; let us go: your cheeks are pale;

    But half my life I leave behind:

    Methinks my friend is richly shrined;

  But I shall pass; my work will fail.

  Yet in these ears, till hearing dies,

   One set slow bell will seem to toll

   The passing of the sweetest soul

 That ever look'd with human eyes.


 I hear it now, and o'er and o'er,

   Eternal greetings to the dead;

   And "Ave, Ave, Ave," said,

 "Adieu, adieu," for evermore.LVIII

  In those sad words I took farewell:

    Like echoes in sepulchral halls,

    As drop by drop the water falls

  In vaults and catacombs, they fell;

  And, falling, idly broke the peace

    Of hearts that beat from day to day,

    Half-conscious of their dying clay,

  And those cold crypts where they shall cease.

  The high Muse answer'd: "Wherefore grieve

   Thy brethren with a fruitless tear?

   Abide a little longer here,

 And thou shalt take a nobler leave."LIX

  O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me

    No casual mistress, but a wife,

    My bosom-friend and half of life;

  As I confess it needs must be;

  O Sorrow, wilt thou rule my blood,

    Be sometimes lovely like a bride,

    And put thy harsher moods aside,

  If thou wilt have me wise and good.

  My centred passion cannot move,

   Nor will it lessen from to-day;

   But I'll have leave at times to play

 As with the creature of my love;


 And set thee forth, for thou art mine,

   With so much hope for years to come,

   That, howsoe'er I know thee, some

 Could hardly tell what name were thine.LX

  He past; a soul of nobler tone:

    My spirit loved and loves him yet,

    Like some poor girl whose heart is set

  On one whose rank exceeds her own.

  He mixing with his proper sphere,

    She finds the baseness of her lot,

    Half jealous of she knows not what,

  And envying all that meet him there.

  The little village looks forlorn;

   She sighs amid her narrow days,

   Moving about the household ways,

 In that dark house where she was born.


 The foolish neighbors come and go,

   And tease her till the day draws by:

   At night she weeps, `How vain am I!

 How should he love a thing so low?'LXI

  If, in thy second state sublime,

    Thy ransom'd reason change replies

    With all the circle of the wise,

  The perfect flower of human time;

  And if thou cast thine eyes below,

    How dimly character'd and slight,

    How dwarf'd a growth of cold and night,

  How blanch'd with darkness must I grow!

  Yet turn thee to the doubtful shore,

   Where thy first form was made a man;

   I loved thee, Spirit, and love, nor can

 The soul of Shakspeare love thee more.

LXII

  Tho' if an eye that's downward cast

    Could make thee somewhat blench or fail,

    Then be my love an idle tale,

  And fading legend of the past;

  And thou, as one that once declined,

    When he was little more than boy,

    On some unworthy heart with joy,

  But lives to wed an equal mind;

  And breathes a novel world, the while

   His other passion wholly dies,

   Or in the light of deeper eyes

 Is matter for a flying smile.LXIII

  Yet pity for a horse o'er-driven,

    And love in which my hound has part,

    Can hang no weight upon my heart

  In its assumptions up to heaven;

  And I am so much more than these,

    As thou, perchance, art more than I,

    And yet I spare them sympathy,

  And I would set their pains at ease.

  So mayst thou watch me where I weep,

   As, unto vaster motions bound,

   The circuits of thine orbit round

 A higher height, a deeper deep.LXIV

  Dost thou look back on what hath been,

    As some divinely gifted man,

    Whose life in low estate began

  And on a simple village green;

  Who breaks his birth's invidious bar,

    And grasps the skirts of happy chance,

    And breasts the blows of circumstance,

  And grapples with his evil star;

  Who makes by force his merit known

   And lives to clutch the golden keys,

   To mould a mighty state's decrees,

 And shape the whisper of the throne;


 And moving up from high to higher,

   Becomes on Fortune's crowning slope

   The pillar of a people's hope,

 The centre of a world's desire;


 Yet feels, as in a pensive dream,

   When all his active powers are still,

   A distant dearness in the hill,

 A secret sweetness in the stream,


 The limit of his narrower fate,

   While yet beside its vocal springs

   He play'd at counsellors and kings,

 With one that was his earliest mate;


 Who ploughs with pain his native lea

   And reaps the labour of his hands,

   Or in the furrow musing stands;

 "Does my old friend remember me?"LXV

  Sweet soul, do with me as thou wilt;

    I lull a fancy trouble-tost

    With "Love's too precious to be lost,

  A little grain shall not be spilt."

  And in that solace can I sing,

    Till out of painful phases wrought

    There flutters up a happy thought,

  Self-balanced on a lightsome wing:

  Since we deserved the name of friends,

   And thine effect so lives in me,

   A part of mine may live in thee

 And move thee on to noble ends.LXVI

 You thought my heart too far diseased;

   You wonder when my fancies play

   To find me gay among the gay,

 Like one with any trifle pleased.

 The shade by which my life was crost,

   Which makes a desert in the mind,

    Has made me kindly with my kind,

 And like to him whose sight is lost;

 Whose feet are guided thro' the land,

   Whose jest among his friends is free,

   Who takes the children on his knee,

 And winds their curls about his hand:


 He plays with threads, he beats his chair

   For pastime, dreaming of the sky;

   His inner day can never die,

 His night of loss is always there.LXVII

 When on my bed the moonlight falls,

   I know that in thy place of rest

   By that broad water of the west,

 There comes a glory on the walls;

 Thy marble bright in dark appears,

   As slowly steals a silver flame

   Along the letters of thy name,

 And o'er the number of thy years.

 The mystic glory swims away;

   From off my bed the moonlight dies;

   And closing eaves of wearied eyes

 I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray;


 And then I know the mist is drawn

   A lucid veil from coast to coast,

   And in the dark church like a ghost

 Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.LXVIII

 When in the down I sink my head,

   Sleep, Death's twin-brother, times my breath;

   Sleep, Death's twin-brother, knows not Death,

 Nor can I dream of thee as dead:

 I walk as ere I walk'd forlorn,

   When all our path was fresh with dew,

   And all the bugle breezes blew

 Reveill´e to the breaking morn.

 But what is this? I turn about,

   I find a trouble in thine eye,

   Which makes me sad I know not why,

 Nor can my dream resolve the doubt:


 But ere the lark hath left the lea

   I wake, and I discern the truth;

   It is the trouble of my youth

 That foolish sleep transfers to thee.LXIX

 I dream'd there would be Spring no more,

   That Nature's ancient power was lost:

   The streets were black with smoke and frost,

 They chatter'd trifles at the door:

 I wander'd from the noisy town,

   I found a wood with thorny boughs:

   I took the thorns to bind my brows,

 I wore them like a civic crown:

 I met with scoffs, I met with scorns

   From youth and babe and hoary hairs:

   They call'd me in the public squares

 The fool that wears a crown of thorns:


 They call'd me fool, they call'd me child:

   I found an angel of the night;

   The voice was low, the look was bright;

 He look'd upon my crown and smiled:


 He reach'd the glory of a hand,

   That seem'd to touch it into leaf:

   The voice was not the voice of grief,

 The words were hard to understand.LXX

 I cannot see the features right,

   When on the gloom I strive to paint

   The face I know; the hues are faint

 And mix with hollow masks of night;

 Cloud-towers by ghostly masons wrought,

   A gulf that ever shuts and gapes,

   A hand that points, and palled shapes

 In shadowy thoroughfares of thought;

 And crowds that stream from yawning doors,

   And shoals of pucker'd faces drive;

   Dark bulks that tumble half alive,

 And lazy lengths on boundless shores;


 Till all at once beyond the will

   I hear a wizard music roll,

   And thro' a lattice on the soul

 Looks thy fair face and makes it still.LXXI

 Sleep, kinsman thou to death and trance

   And madness, thou hast forged at last

   A night-long Present of the Past

 In which we went thro' summer France.

 Hadst thou such credit with the soul?

   Then bring an opiate trebly strong,

   Drug down the blindfold sense of wrong

 That so my pleasure may be whole;

 While now we talk as once we talk'd

   Of men and minds, the dust of change,

   The days that grow to something strange,

 In walking as of old we walk'd


 Beside the river's wooded reach,

   The fortress, and the mountain ridge,

   The cataract flashing from the bridge,

 The breaker breaking on the beach.LXXII

 Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,

   And howlest, issuing out of night,

   With blasts that blow the poplar white,

 And lash with storm the streaming pane?

 Day, when my crown'd estate begun

   To pine in that reverse of doom,

   Which sicken'd every living bloom,

 And blurr'd the splendour of the sun;

 Who usherest in the dolorous hour

   With thy quick tears that make the rose

   Pull sideways, and the daisy close

 Her crimson fringes to the shower;


 Who might'st have heaved a windless flame

   Up the deep East, or, whispering, play'd

   A chequer-work of beam and shade

 Along the hills, yet look'd the same.


 As wan, as chill, as wild as now;

   Day, mark'd as with some hideous crime,

   When the dark hand struck down thro' time,

 And cancell'd nature's best: but thou,


 Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows

   Thro' clouds that drench the morning star,

   And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar,

 And sow the sky with flying boughs,


 And up thy vault with roaring sound

   Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;

   Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,

 And hide thy shame beneath the ground.LXXIII

 So many worlds, so much to do,

   So little done, such things to be,

   How know I what had need of thee,

 For thou wert strong as thou wert true?

 The fame is quench'd that I foresaw,

   The head hath miss'd an earthly wreath:

   I curse not nature, no, nor death;

 For nothing is that errs from law.

 We pass; the path that each man trod

   Is dim, or will be dim, with weeds:

   What fame is left for human deeds

 In endless age? It rests with God.


 O hollow wraith of dying fame,

   Fade wholly, while the soul exults,

   And self-infolds the large results

 Of force that would have forged a name.LXXIV

 As sometimes in a dead man's face,

   To those that watch it more and more,

   A likeness, hardly seen before,

 Comes out -- to some one of his race:

 So, dearest, now thy brows are cold,

   I see thee what thou art, and know

   Thy likeness to the wise below,

 Thy kindred with the great of old.

 But there is more than I can see,

   And what I see I leave unsaid,

   Nor speak it, knowing Death has made

 His darkness beautiful with thee.


 I leave thy praises unexpress'd

   In verse that brings myself relief,

   And by the measure of my grief

 I leave thy greatness to be guess'd;


 What practice howsoe'er expert

   In fitting aptest words to things,

   Or voice the richest-toned that sings,

 Hath power to give thee as thou wert?


 I care not in these fading days

   To raise a cry that lasts not long,

   And round thee with the breeze of song

 To stir a little dust of praise.


 Thy leaf has perish'd in the green,

   And, while we breathe beneath the sun,

   The world which credits what is done

 Is cold to all that might have been.


 So here shall silence guard thy fame;

   But somewhere, out of human view,

   Whate'er thy hands are set to do

 Is wrought with tumult of acclaim.LXXV

 Take wings of fancy, and ascend,

   And in a moment set thy face

   Where all the starry heavens of space

 Are sharpen'd to a needle's end;

 Take wings of foresight; lighten thro'

   The secular abyss to come,

   And lo, thy deepest lays are dumb

 Before the mouldering of a yew;

 And if the matin songs, that woke

   The darkness of our planet, last,

   Thine own shall wither in the vast,

 Ere half the lifetime of an oak.


 Ere these have clothed their branchy bowers

   With fifty Mays, thy songs are vain;

   And what are they when these remain

 The ruin'd shells of hollow towers?LXXVII

 What hope is here for modern rhyme

   To him, who turns a musing eye

   On songs, and deeds, and lives, that lie

 Foreshorten'd in the tract of time?

 These mortal lullabies of pain

   May bind a book, may line a box,

   May serve to curl a maiden's locks;

 Or when a thousand moons shall wane

 A man upon a stall may find,

   And, passing, turn the page that tells

   A grief, then changed to something else,

 Sung by a long-forgotten mind.


 But what of that? My darken'd ways

   Shall ring with music all the same;

   To breathe my loss is more than fame,

 To utter love more sweet than praise.LXXVIII

 Again at Christmas did we weave

   The holly round the Christmas hearth;

   The silent snow possess'd the earth,

 And calmly fell our Christmas-eve:

 The yule-clog sparkled keen with frost,

   No wing of wind the region swept,

   But over all things brooding slept

 The quiet sense of something lost.

 As in the winters left behind,

   Again our ancient games had place,

   The mimic picture's breathing grace,

 And dance and song and hoodman-blind.


 Who show'd a token of distress?

   No single tear, no mark of pain:

   O sorrow, then can sorrow wane?

 O grief, can grief be changed to less?


 O last regret, regret can die!

   No -- mixt with all this mystic frame,

   Her deep relations are the same,

 But with long use her tears are dry.LXXIX

 "More than my brothers are to me," --

   Let this not vex thee, noble heart!

   I know thee of what force thou art

 To hold the costliest love in fee.

 But thou and I are one in kind,

   As moulded like in Nature's mint;

   And hill and wood and field did print

 The same sweet forms in either mind.

 For us the same cold streamlet curl'd

   Thro' all his eddying coves, the same

   All winds that roam the twilight came

 In whispers of the beauteous world.


 At one dear knee we proffer'd vows,

   One lesson from one book we learn'd,

   Ere childhood's flaxen ringlet turn'd

 To black and brown on kindred brows.


 And so my wealth resembles thine,

   But he was rich where I was poor,

   And he supplied my want the more

 As his unlikeness fitted mine.LXXX

 If any vague desire should rise,

   That holy Death ere Arthur died

   Had moved me kindly from his side,

 And dropt the dust on tearless eyes;

 Then fancy shapes, as fancy can,

   The grief my loss in him had wrought,

   A grief as deep as life or thought,

 But stay'd in peace with God and man.

 I make a picture in the brain;

   I hear the sentence that he speaks;

   He bears the burthen of the weeks

 But turns his burthen into gain.


 His credit thus shall set me free;

   And, influence-rich to soothe and save,

   Unused example from the grave

 Reach out dead hands to comfort me.LXXXI

 Could I have said while he was here,

   "My love shall now no further range;

   There cannot come a mellower change,

 For now is love mature in ear"?

 Love, then, had hope of richer store:

   What end is here to my complaint?

   This haunting whisper makes me faint,

 "More years had made me love thee more.'

 But Death returns an answer sweet:

   "My sudden frost was sudden gain,

   And gave all ripeness to the grain,

 It might have drawn from after-heat."LXXXII

 I wage not any feud with Death

   For changes wrought on form and face;

   No lower life that earth's embrace

 May breed with him, can fright my faith.

 Eternal process moving on,

   From state to state the spirit walks;

   And these are but the shatter'd stalks,

 Or ruin'd chrysalis of one.

 Nor blame I Death, because he bare

   The use of virtue out of earth:

   I know transplanted human worth

 Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.


 For this alone on Death I wreak

   The wrath that garners in my heart;

   He put our lives so far apart

 We cannot hear each other speak.LXXIII

 Dip down upon the northern shore,

   O sweet new-year delaying long;

   Thou doest expectant nature wrong;

 Delaying long, delay no more.

 What stays thee from the clouded noons,

   Thy sweetness from its proper place?

   Can trouble live with April days,

 Or sadness in the summer moons?

 Bring orchis, bring the foxglove spire,

   The little speedwell's darling blue,

   Deep tulips dash'd with fiery dew,

 Laburnums, dropping-wells of fire.


 O thou, new-year, delaying long,

   Delayest the sorrow in my blood,

   That longs to burst a frozen bud

 And flood a fresher throat with song.LXXXIV

 When I contemplate all alone

   The life that had been thine below,

   And fix my thoughts on all the glow

 To which thy crescent would have grown;

 I see thee sitting crown'd with good,

   A central warmth diffusing bliss

   In glance and smile, and clasp and kiss,

 On all the branches of thy blood;

 Thy blood, my friend, and partly mine;

   For now the day was drawing on,

   When thou should'st link thy life with one

 Of mine own house, and boys of thine


 Had babbled "Uncle" on my knee;

   But that remorseless iron hour

   Made cypress of her orange flower,

 Despair of Hope, and earth of thee.


 I seem to meet their least desire,

   To clap their cheeks, to call them mine.

   I see their unborn faces shine

 Beside the never-lighted fire.


 I see myself an honor'd guest,

   Thy partner in the flowery walk

   Of letters, genial table-talk,

 Or deep dispute, and graceful jest;


 While now thy prosperous labor fills

   The lips of men with honest praise,

   And sun by sun the happy days

 Descend below the golden hills


 With promise of a morn as fair,

   And all the train of bounteous hours

   Conduct by paths of growing powers,

 To reverence and the silver hair;


 Till slowly worn her earthly robe,

   Her lavish mission richly wrought,

   Leaving great legacies of thought,

 Thy spirit should fail from off the globe;


 What time mine own might also flee,

   As link'd with thine in love and fate,

   And, hovering o'er the dolorous strait

 To the other shore, involved in thee,


 Arrive at last the blessed goal,

   And He that died in Holy Land

   Would reach us out the shining hand,

 And take us as a single soul.


What reed was that on which I leant?

   Ah, backward fancy, wherefore wake

   The old bitterness again, and break

 The low beginnings of content.LXXXV

 This truth came borne with bier and pall

   I felt it, when I sorrow'd most,

   'Tis better to have loved and lost,

 Than never to have loved at all --

 O true in word, and tried in deed,

   Demanding, so to bring relief

   To this which is our common grief,

 What kind of life is that I lead;

 And whether trust in things above

   Be dimm'd of sorrow, or sustain'd;

   And whether love for him have drain'd

 My capabilities of love;


 Your words have virtue such as draws

   A faithful answer from the breast,

   Thro' light reproaches, half exprest,

 And loyal unto kindly laws.


 My blood an even tenor kept,

   Till on mine ear this message falls,

   That in Vienna's fatal walls

 God's finger touch'd him, and he slept.


 The great Intelligences fair

   That range above our mortal state,

   In circle round the blessed gate,

 Received and gave him welcome there;


 And led him thro' the blissful climes,

   And show'd him in the fountain fresh

   All knowledge that the sons of flesh

 Shall gather in the cycled times.


 But I remain'd, whose hopes were dim,

   Whose life, whose thoughts were little worth,

   To wander on a darken'd earth,

 Where all things round me breathed of him. '


 O friendship, equal-poised control,

   O heart, with kindliest motion warm,

   O sacred essence, other form,

 O solemn ghost, O crowned soul!


 Yet none could better know than I,

   How much of act at human hands

   The sense of human will demands

 By which we dare to live or die.


 Whatever way my days decline,

   I felt and feel, tho' left alone,

   His being working in mine own,

 The footsteps of his life in mine;


 A life that all the Muses deck'd

   With gifts of grace, that might express

   All-comprehensive tenderness,

 All-subtilising intellect:


 And so my passion hath not swerved

   To works of weakness, but I find

   An image comforting the mind,

 And in my grief a strength reserved.


 Likewise the imaginative woe,

   That loved to handle spiritual strife

   Diffused the shock thro' all my life,

 But in the present broke the blow.


 My pulses therefore beat again

   For other friends that once I met;

   Nor can it suit me to forget

 The mighty hopes that make us men.


 I woo your love: I count it crime

   To mourn for any overmuch;

   I, the divided half of such

 A friendship as had master'd Time;


 Which masters Time indeed, and is

   Eternal, separate from fears:

   The all-assuming months and years

 Can take no part away from this:


 But Summer on the steaming floods,

   And Spring that swells the narrow brooks,

   And Autumn, with a noise of rooks,

 That gather in the waning woods,

O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,

       O Priestess in the vaults of Death,

       O sweet and bitter in a breath,

What whispers from thy lying lip?

"The stars," she whispers, "blindly run;

       A web is wov'n across the sky;

       From out waste places comes a cry,

And murmurs from the dying sun:

"And all the phantom, Nature, stands--

      With all the music in her tone,

      A hollow echo of my own,--

A hollow form with empty hands."


And shall I take a thing so blind,

      Embrace her as my natural good;

      Or crush her, like a vice of blood,

Upon the threshold of the mind?

Poem 47: In Memoriam A. H. H. Obiit MDCCCXXXIII: 30. With trembling

With trembling fingers did we weave

       The holly round the Christmas hearth;

       A rainy cloud possess'd the earth,

And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.

At our old pastimes in the hall

       We gambol'd, making vain pretence

       Of gladness, with an awful sense

Of one mute Shadow watching all.

We paused: the winds were in the beech:

      We heard them sweep the winter land;

      And in a circle hand-in-hand

Sat silent, looking each at each.


Then echo-like our voices rang;

      We sung, tho' every eye was dim,

      A merry song we sang with him

Last year: impetuously we sang:


We ceased: a gentler feeling crept

      Upon us: surely rest is meet:

      "They rest," we said, "their sleep is sweet,"

And silence follow'd, and we wept.


Our voices took a higher range;

      Once more we sang: "They do not die

      Nor lose their mortal sympathy,

Nor change to us, although they change;


"Rapt from the fickle and the frail

      With gather'd power, yet the same,

      Pierces the keen seraphic flame

From orb to orb, from veil to veil."


Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,

      Draw forth the cheerful day from night:

      O Father, touch the east, and light

The light that shone when Hope was born.

Poem 48: In Memoriam A. H. H. Obiit: 124. That which we dare invoke

That which we dare invoke to bless;

       Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt;

       He, They, One, All; within, without;

   The Power in darkness whom we guess;

   I found Him not in world or sun,

       Or eagle's wing, or insect's eye;

       Nor thro' the questions men may try,

   The petty cobwebs we have spun:

   If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep,

      I heard a voice, "Believe no more,"

      And heard an ever-breaking shore

  That tumbled in the Godless deep,


  A warmth within the breast would melt

      The freezing reason's colder part,

      And like a man in wrath the heart

  Stood up and answer'd, "I have felt."


  No, like a child in doubt and fear:

      But that blind clamour made me wise;

      Then was I as a child that cries,

  But crying, knows his father near;


  And what I am beheld again

      What is, and no man understands;

      And out of darkness came the hands

  That reach thro' nature, moulding men.

To-night ungather'd let us leave

       This laurel, let this holly stand:

       We live within the stranger's land,

And strangely falls our Christmas-eve.

Our father's dust is left alone

       And silent under other snows:

       There in due time the woodbine blows,

The violet comes, but we are gone.

No more shall wayward grief abuse

      The genial hour with mask and mime;

      For change of place, like growth of time,

Has broke the bond of dying use.


Let cares that petty shadows cast,

      By which our lives are chiefly proved,

      A little spare the night I loved,

And hold it solemn to the past.


But let no footstep beat the floor,

      Nor bowl of wassail mantle warm;

      For who would keep an ancient form

Thro' which the spirit breathes no more?


Be neither song, nor game, nor feast;

      Nor harp be touch'd, nor flute be blown;

      No dance, no motion, save alone

What lightens in the lucid east


Of rising worlds by yonder wood.

      Long sleeps the summer in the seed;

      Run out your measured arcs, and lead

The closing cycle rich in good.

The chestnut pattering to the ground:

Calm and deep peace on this high wold,

       And all the silvery gossamers

That twinkle into green and gold:

Calm and still light on yon great plain

      That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,

      And crowded farms and lessening towers,

To mingle with the bounding main:


Calm and deep peace in this wide air,

      These leaves that redden to the fall;

      And in my heart, if calm at all,

If any calm, a calm despair:


Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,

      And waves that sway themselves in rest,

      And dead calm in that noble breast

Which heaves but with the heaving deep.

The solid earth whereon we tread

In tracts of fluent heat began,

Till at the last arose the man;


Who throve and branch'd from clime to clime,

      Like glories, move his course, and show

That life is not as idle ore,


But iron dug from central gloom,

      And heated hot with burning fears,

      And dipt in baths of hissing tears,

And batter'd with the shocks of doom


To shape and use. Arise and fly

      Move upward, working out the beast,

And let the ape and tiger die.

    To one that with us works, and trust,

    With faith that comes of self-control,

       The truths that never can be proved

       Until we close with all we loved,

   And all we flow from, soul in soul.------


   O true and tried, so well and long,

       Demand not thou a marriage lay;

       In that it is thy marriage day

   Is music more than any song.


   Nor have I felt so much of bliss

       Since first he told me that he loved

       A daughter of our house; nor proved

   Since that dark day a day like this; 


   Tho' I since then have number'd o'er

       Some thrice three years: they went and came,

       Remade the blood and changed the frame,

   And yet is love not less, but more;


   No longer caring to embalm

       In dying songs a dead regret,

       But like a statue solid-set,

   And moulded in colossal calm.


   Regret is dead, but love is more

       Than in the summers that are flown,

       For I myself with these have grown

   To something greater than before;


   Which makes appear the songs I made

       As echoes out of weaker times,

       As half but idle brawling rhymes,

   The sport of random sun and shade.


   But where is she, the bridal flower,

       That must be made a wife ere noon?

       She enters, glowing like the moon

   Of Eden on its bridal bower:


   On me she bends her blissful eyes

       And then on thee; they meet thy look

       And brighten like the star that shook

   Betwixt the palms of paradise.


   O when her life was yet in bud,

       He too foretold the perfect rose.

       For thee she grew, for thee she grows

   For ever, and as fair as good.


   And thou art worthy; full of power;

       As gentle; liberal-minded, great,

       Consistent; wearing all that weight

   Of learning lightly like a flower.


   But now set out: the noon is near,

       And I must give away the bride;

       She fears not, or with thee beside

   And me behind her, will not fear.


   For I that danced her on my knee,

       That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,

       That shielded all her life from harm

    At last must part with her to thee;


   Now waiting to be made a wife,

       Her feet, my darling, on the dead;

       Their pensive tablets round her head,

   And the most living words of life


   Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,

       The "wilt thou" answer'd, and again

       The "wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain

   Her sweet "I will" has made you one.


   Now sign your names, which shall be read,

       Mute symbols of a joyful morn,

       By village eyes as yet unborn;

   The names are sign'd, and overhead


   Begins the clash and clang that tells

       The joy to every wandering breeze;

       The blind wall rocks, and on the trees

   The dead leaf trembles to the bells.


   O happy hour, and happier hours

       Await them. Many a merry face

       Salutes them--maidens of the place,

   That pelt us in the porch with flowers.


   O happy hour, behold the bride

       With him to whom her hand I gave.

       They leave the porch, they pass the grave

   That has to-day its sunny side.


   To-day the grave is bright for me,

       For them the light of life increased,

       Who stay to share the morning feast,

   Who rest to-night beside the sea.


   Let all my genial spirits advance

       To meet and greet a whiter sun;

       My drooping memory will not shun

   The foaming grape of eastern France.


   It circles round, and fancy plays,

       And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,

       As drinking health to bride and groom

   We wish them store of happy days.


   Nor count me all to blame if I

       Conjecture of a stiller guest,

       Perchance, perchance, among the rest,

  And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.



  But they must go, the time draws on,

     And those white-favour'd horses wait;

     They rise, but linger; it is late;

  Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.



  A shade falls on us like the dark

     From little cloudlets on the grass,

     But sweeps away as out we pass

  To range the woods, to roam the park,



  Discussing how their courtship grew,

     And talk of others that are wed,

     And how she look'd, and what he said,

  And back we come at fall of dew.



  Again the feast, the speech, the glee,

     The shade of passing thought, the wealth

     Of words and wit, the double health,

  The crowning cup, the three-times-three,



  And last the dance,--till I retire:

     Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,

     And high in heaven the streaming cloud,

  And on the downs a rising fire:



  And rise, O moon, from yonder down,

     Till over down and over dale

     All night the shining vapour sail

  And pass the silent-lighted town,



  The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,

     And catch at every mountain head,

     And o'er the friths that branch and spread

  Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;



  And touch with shade the bridal doors,

     With tender gloom the roof, the wall;

     And breaking let the splendour fall

  To spangle all the happy shores



  By which they rest, and ocean sounds,

     And, star and system rolling past,

     A soul shall draw from out the vast

  And strike his being into bounds,



  And, moved thro' life of lower phase,

     Result in man, be born and think,

     And act and love, a closer link

  Betwixt us and the crowning race



  Of those that, eye to eye, shall look

     On knowledge; under whose command

     Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand

  Is Nature like an open book;



  No longer half-akin to brute,

     For all we thought and loved and did,

     And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed

  Of what in them is flower and fruit;



  Whereof the man, that with me trod

     This planet, was a noble type

     Appearing ere the times were ripe,

  That friend of mine who lives in God,



  That God, which ever lives and loves,

     One God, one law, one element,

     And one far-off divine event,

  To which the whole creation moves.

       From scarped cliff and quarried stone

       She cries, "A thousand types are gone:

I care for nothing, all shall go.

"Thou makest thine appeal to me:

       I bring to life, I bring to death:

       The spirit does but mean the breath:

I know no more." And he, shall he,

Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,

      Such splendid purpose in his eyes,

      Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,

Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,


Who trusted God was love indeed

      And love Creation's final law--

      Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw

With ravine, shriek'd against his creed--


Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,

      Who battled for the True, the Just,

      Be blown about the desert dust,

Or seal'd within the iron hills?


No more? A monster then, a dream,

      A discord. Dragons of the prime,

      That tare each other in their slime,

Were mellow music match'd with him.


O life as futile, then, as frail!

      O for thy voice to soothe and bless!

      What hope of answer, or redress?

Behind the veil, behind the veil.

Poem 66: In Memoriam A. H. H.: 6. "One writes, that Other Friends.... "

One writes, that "Other friends remain,"

    That "Loss is common to the race"--

    And common is the commonplace,

  And vacant chaff well meant for grain.

  That loss is common would not make

    My own less bitter, rather more.

    Too common! Never morning wore

  To evening, but some heart did break.

  O father, wheresoe'er thou be,

    Who pledgest now thy gallant son,

    A shot, ere half thy draught be done,

 Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.


 O mother, praying God will save

    Thy sailor,--while thy head is bow'd,

    His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud

 Drops in his vast and wandering grave.


  Ye know no more than I who wrought

    At that last hour to please him well;

    Who mused on all I had to tell,

  And something written, something thought;


 Expecting still his advent home;

    And ever met him on his way

    With wishes, thinking, "here to-day,"

 Or "here to-morrow will he come."


 O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,

    That sitteth ranging golden hair;

    And glad to find thyself so fair,

 Poor child, that waiteth for thy love!


 For now her father's chimney glows

    In expectation of a guest;

    And thinking "this will please him best,"

 She takes a riband or a rose;


 For he will see them on to-night;

    And with the thought her colour burns;

    And, having left the glass, she turns

 Once more to set a ringlet right;


 And, even when she turn'd, the curse

    Had fallen, and her future Lord

    Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,

 Or kill'd in falling from his horse.


 O what to her shall be the end?

    And what to me remains of good?

    To her, perpetual maidenhood,

 And unto me no second friend.

When on my bed the moonlight falls,

       I know that in thy place of rest

       By that broad water of the west,

There comes a glory on the walls:

Thy marble bright in dark appears,

       As slowly steals a silver flame

       Along the letters of thy name,

And o'er the number of thy years.

The mystic glory swims away;

      From off my bed the moonlight dies;

      And closing eaves of wearied eyes

I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray:


And then I know the mist is drawn

      A lucid veil from coast to coast,

      And in the dark church like a ghost

Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.

       Behold me, for I cannot sleep,

       And like a guilty thing I creep

He is not here; but far away

On the bald street breaks the blank day.

Along the hills, yet look'd the same.


As wan, as chill, as wild as now;

And cancell'd nature's best: but thou,


Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows

      Thro' clouds that drench the morning star,

      And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar,

And sow the sky with flying boughs,


And up thy vault with roaring sound

      Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;

      Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,

And hide thy shame beneath the ground.

Again at Christmas did we weave

       The holly round the Christmas hearth;

And calmly fell our Christmas-eve:


The yule-log sparkled keen with frost,

       But over all things brooding slept

The quiet sense of something lost.


As in the winters left behind,

      Again our ancient games had place,

      The mimic picture's breathing grace,

And dance and song and hoodman-blind.


Who show'd a token of distress?

      No single tear, no mark of pain:

      O sorrow, then can sorrow wane?

O grief, can grief be changed to less?


O last regret, regret can die!

      No--mixt with all this mystic frame,

      Her deep relations are the same,

But with long use her tears are dry.

Poem 73: In Memoriam A. H. H.: 95. By night we linger'd on the lawn

By night we linger'd on the lawn,

       For underfoot the herb was dry;

       And genial warmth; and o'er the sky

   The silvery haze of summer drawn;

   And calm that let the tapers burn

       Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd:

       The brook alone far-off was heard,

   And on the board the fluttering urn:

   And bats went round in fragrant skies,

      And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes

      That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes

  And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;


  While now we sang old songs that peal'd

      From knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at ease,

      The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees

  Laid their dark arms about the field.


  But when those others, one by one,

      Withdrew themselves from me and night,

      And in the house light after light

  Went out, and I was all alone,


  A hunger seized my heart; I read

      Of that glad year which once had been,

      In those fall'n leaves which kept their green,

  The noble letters of the dead:


  And strangely on the silence broke

      The silent-speaking words, and strange

      Was love's dumb cry defying change

  To test his worth; and strangely spoke


  The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell

      On doubts that drive the coward back,

      And keen thro' wordy snares to track

  Suggestion to her inmost cell.


  So word by word, and line by line,

      The dead man touch'd me from the past,

      And all at once it seem'd at last

  The living soul was flash'd on mine,


  And mine in this was wound, and whirl'd

      About empyreal heights of thought,

      And came on that which is, and caught

  The deep pulsations of the world,


  Æonian music measuring out

      The steps of Time--the shocks of Chance--

      The blows of Death. At length my trance

  Was cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt.


  Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame

      In matter-moulded forms of speech,

      Or ev'n for intellect to reach

  Thro' memory that which I became:


  Till now the doubtful dusk reveal'd

      The knolls once more where, couch'd at ease,

      The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees

  Laid their dark arms about the field:


  And suck'd from out the distant gloom

      A breeze began to tremble o'er

      The large leaves of the sycamore,

  And fluctuate all the still perfume,


  And gathering freshlier overhead,

      Rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung

      The heavy-folded rose, and flung

   The lilies to and fro, and said


  "The dawn, the dawn," and died away;

      And East and West, without a breath,

      Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,

  To broaden into boundless day.

You tell me, doubt is Devil-born.

I know not: one indeed I knew

But ever strove to make it true:

Perplext in faith, but pure in deeds,

      There lives more faith in honest doubt,

Believe me, than in half the creeds.


He fought his doubts and gather'd strength,

      He would not make his judgment blind,

      He faced the spectres of the mind

And laid them: thus he came at length


To find a stronger faith his own;

      And Power was with him in the night,

      Which makes the darkness and the light,

And dwells not in the light alone,

Strong Son of God, immortal Love,

       Whom we, that have not seen thy face,

       By faith, and faith alone, embrace,

   Believing where we cannot prove;

   Thine are these orbs of light and shade;

       Thou madest Life in man and brute;

       Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot

   Is on the skull which thou hast made.

   Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:

      Thou madest man, he knows not why,

      He thinks he was not made to die;

  And thou hast made him: thou art just.


  Thou seemest human and divine,

      The highest, holiest manhood, thou.

      Our wills are ours, we know not how,

  Our wills are ours, to make them thine.


  Our little systems have their day;

      They have their day and cease to be:

      They are but broken lights of thee,

  And thou, O Lord, art more than they.


  We have but faith: we cannot know;

      For knowledge is of things we see;

      And yet we trust it comes from thee,

  A beam in darkness: let it grow.


  Let knowledge grow from more to more,

      But more of reverence in us dwell;

      That mind and soul, according well,

  May make one music as before,


  But vaster. We are fools and slight;

      We mock thee when we do not fear:

      But help thy foolish ones to bear;

  Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.


  Forgive what seem'd my sin in me,

      What seem'd my worth since I began;

      For merit lives from man to man,

  And not from man, O Lord, to thee.


  Forgive my grief for one removed,

      Thy creature, whom I found so fair.

      I trust he lives in thee, and there

  I find him worthier to be loved.


  Forgive these wild and wandering cries,

      Confusions of a wasted youth;

      Forgive them where they fail in truth,

  And in thy wisdom make me wise.

Poem 80: Lady Clare

IT was the time when lilies blow,

    And clouds are highest up in air,

Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe

    To give his cousin, Lady Clare.


I trow they did not part in scorn-

    Lovers long-betroth'd were they:

They too will wed the morrow morn:

    God's blessing on the day !


'He does not love me for my birth,

    Nor for my lands so broad and fair;

He loves me for my own true worth,

    And that is well,' said Lady Clare.


In there came old Alice the nurse,

    Said, 'Who was this that went from thee?'

'It was my cousin,' said Lady Clare,

    'To-morrow he weds with me.'


'O God be thank'd!' said Alice the nurse,

    ' That all comes round so just and fair:

Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,

    And you are not the Lady Clare.'


'Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?'

    Said Lady Clare, 'that ye speak so wild?'

'As God's above,' said Alice the nurse,

    ' I speak the truth: you are my child.


'The old Earl's daughter died at my breast;

    I speak the truth, as I live by bread!

I buried her like my own sweet child,

    And put my child in her stead.'


'Falsely, falsely have ye done,

    O mother,' she said, ' if this be true,

To keep the best man under the sun

    So many years from his due.'


'Nay now, my child,' said Alice the nurse,

    'But keep the secret for your life,

And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,

    When you are man and wife.'


' If I'm a beggar born,' she said,

    'I will speak out, for I dare not lie.

Pull off, pull off, the brooch of gold,

    And fling the diamond necklace by.'


'Nay now, my child,' said Alice the nurse,

    'But keep the secret all ye can.'

She said, ' Not so: but I will know

    If there be any faith in man.'


'Nay now, what faith ?' said Alice the nurse,

    'The man will cleave unto his right.'

'And he shall have it,' the lady replied,

    'Tho' I should die to-night.'


'Yet give one kiss to your mother dear !

    Alas, my child, I sinn'd for thee.'

'O mother, mother, mother,' she said,

    'So strange it seems to me.


'Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,

    My mother dear, if this be so,

And lay your hand upon my head,

    And bless me, mother, ere I go.'


She clad herself in a russet gown,

    She was no longer Lady Clare:

She went by dale, and she went by down,

    With a single rose in her hair.


The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought

    Leapt up from where she lay,

Dropt her head in the maiden's hand,

    And follow'd her all the way.


Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:

    'O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!

Why come you drest like a village maid,

    That are the flower of the earth?'


'If I come drest like a village maid,

    I am but as my fortunes are:

I am a beggar born,' she said,

    'And not the Lady Clare.'


'Play me no tricks,' said Lord Ronald,

     'For I am yours in word and in deed.

Play me no tricks,' said Lord Ronald,

     'Your riddle is hard to read.'


O and proudly stood she up !

     Her heart within her did not fail:

She look'd into Lord Ronald's eyes,

     And told him all her nurse's tale.


He laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn:

     He turn'd and kiss'd her where she stood:

'If you are not the heiress born,

     And I,' said he, 'the next in blood--


'If you are not the heiress born,

     And I,' said he, ' the lawful heir,

We two will wed to-morrow morn,

     And you shall still be Lady Clare.'

Poem 81: Lancelot And Elaine

Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,

Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat,

High in her chamber up a tower to the east

Guarded the sacred shield of Lancelot;

Which first she placed where the morning's earliest ray

Might strike it, and awake her with the gleam;

Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it

A case of silk, and braided thereupon

All the devices blazoned on the shield

In their own tinct, and added, of her wit,

A border fantasy of branch and flower,

And yellow-throated nestling in the nest.

Nor rested thus content, but day by day,

Leaving her household and good father, climbed

That eastern tower, and entering barred her door,

Stript off the case, and read the naked shield,

Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms,

Now made a pretty history to herself

Of every dint a sword had beaten in it,

And every scratch a lance had made upon it,

Conjecturing when and where:  this cut is fresh;

That ten years back; this dealt him at Caerlyle;

That at Caerleon; this at Camelot:

And ah God's mercy, what a stroke was there!

And here a thrust that might have killed, but God

Broke the strong lance, and rolled his enemy down,

And saved him:  so she lived in fantasy.


How came the lily maid by that good shield

Of Lancelot, she that knew not even his name?

He left it with her, when he rode to tilt

For the great diamond in the diamond jousts,

Which Arthur had ordained, and by that name

Had named them, since a diamond was the prize.


For Arthur, long before they crowned him King,

Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,

Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.

A horror lived about the tarn, and clave

Like its own mists to all the mountain side:

For here two brothers, one a king, had met

And fought together; but their names were lost;

And each had slain his brother at a blow;

And down they fell and made the glen abhorred:

And there they lay till all their bones were bleached,

And lichened into colour with the crags:

And he, that once was king, had on a crown

Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.

And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,

All in a misty moonshine, unawares

Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull

Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown

Rolled into light, and turning on its rims

Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:

And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,

And set it on his head, and in his heart

Heard murmurs, 'Lo, thou likewise shalt be King.'


Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems

Plucked from the crown, and showed them to his knights,

Saying, 'These jewels, whereupon I chanced

Divinely, are the kingdom's, not the King's--

For public use:  henceforward let there be,

Once every year, a joust for one of these:

For so by nine years' proof we needs must learn

Which is our mightiest, and ourselves shall grow

In use of arms and manhood, till we drive

The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land

Hereafter, which God hinder.'  Thus he spoke:

And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still

Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,

With purpose to present them to the Queen,

When all were won; but meaning all at once

To snare her royal fancy with a boon

Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.


Now for the central diamond and the last

And largest, Arthur, holding then his court

Hard on the river nigh the place which now

Is this world's hugest, let proclaim a joust

At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh

Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,

'Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move

To these fair jousts?'  'Yea, lord,' she said, 'ye know it.'

'Then will ye miss,' he answered, 'the great deeds

Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,

A sight ye love to look on.'  And the Queen

Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly

On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.

He thinking that he read her meaning there,

'Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more

Than many diamonds,' yielded; and a heart

Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen

(However much he yearned to make complete

The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)

Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,

'Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,

And lets me from the saddle;' and the King

Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.

No sooner gone than suddenly she began:


'To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!

Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights

Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd

Will murmur, "Lo the shameless ones, who take

Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!"'

Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:

'Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,

My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.

Then of the crowd ye took no more account

Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,

When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,

And every voice is nothing.  As to knights,

Them surely can I silence with all ease.

But now my loyal worship is allowed

Of all men:  many a bard, without offence,

Has linked our names together in his lay,

Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,

The pearl of beauty:  and our knights at feast

Have pledged us in this union, while the King

Would listen smiling.  How then? is there more?

Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,

Now weary of my service and devoir,

Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?'


She broke into a little scornful laugh:

'Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,

That passionate perfection, my good lord--

But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?

He never spake word of reproach to me,

He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,

He cares not for me:  only here today

There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:

Some meddling rogue has tampered with him--else

Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,

And swearing men to vows impossible,

To make them like himself:  but, friend, to me

He is all fault who hath no fault at all:

For who loves me must have a touch of earth;

The low sun makes the colour:  I am yours,

Not Arthur's, as ye know, save by the bond.

And therefore hear my words:  go to the jousts:

The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream

When sweetest; and the vermin voices here

May buzz so loud--we scorn them, but they sting.'


Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:

'And with what face, after my pretext made,

Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I

Before a King who honours his own word,

As if it were his God's?'


                        'Yea,' said the Queen,

'A moral child without the craft to rule,

Else had he not lost me:  but listen to me,

If I must find you wit:  we hear it said

That men go down before your spear at a touch,

But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,

This conquers:  hide it therefore; go unknown:

Win! by this kiss you will:  and our true King

Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,

As all for glory; for to speak him true,

Ye know right well, how meek soe'er he seem,

No keener hunter after glory breathes.

He loves it in his knights more than himself:

They prove to him his work:  win and return.'


Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,

Wroth at himself.  Not willing to be known,

He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,

Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,

And there among the solitary downs,

Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;

Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,

That all in loops and links among the dales

Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw

Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.

Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.

Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,

Who let him into lodging and disarmed.

And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;

And issuing found the Lord of Astolat

With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,

Moving to meet him in the castle court;

And close behind them stept the lily maid

Elaine, his daughter:  mother of the house

There was not:  some light jest among them rose

With laughter dying down as the great knight

Approached them:  then the Lord of Astolat:

'Whence comes thou, my guest, and by what name

Livest thou between the lips? for by thy state

And presence I might guess thee chief of those,

After the King, who eat in Arthur's halls.

Him have I seen:  the rest, his Table Round,

Known as they are, to me they are unknown.'


Then answered Sir Lancelot, the chief of knights:

'Known am I, and of Arthur's hall, and known,

What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.

But since I go to joust as one unknown

At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,

Hereafter ye shall know me--and the shield--

I pray you lend me one, if such you have,

Blank, or at least with some device not mine.'


Then said the Lord of Astolat, 'Here is Torre's:

Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.

And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.

His ye can have.'  Then added plain Sir Torre,

'Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it.'

Here laughed the father saying, 'Fie, Sir Churl,

Is that answer for a noble knight?

Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,

He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,

Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,

And set it in this damsel's golden hair,

To make her thrice as wilful as before.'


'Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not

Before this noble knight,' said young Lavaine,

'For nothing.  Surely I but played on Torre:

He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:

A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt

That some one put this diamond in her hand,

And that it was too slippery to be held,

And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,

The castle-well, belike; and then I said

That IF I went and IF I fought and won it

(But all was jest and joke among ourselves)

Then must she keep it safelier.  All was jest.

But, father, give me leave, an if he will,

To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:

Win shall I not, but do my best to win:

Young as I am, yet would I do my best.'


'So will ye grace me,' answered Lancelot,

Smiling a moment, 'with your fellowship

O'er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,

Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:

And you shall win this diamond,--as I hear

It is a fair large diamond,--if ye may,

And yield it to this maiden, if ye will.'

'A fair large diamond,' added plain Sir Torre,

'Such be for queens, and not for simple maids.'

Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,

Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,

Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement

Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,

Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:

'If what is fair be but for what is fair,

And only queens are to be counted so,

Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid

Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,

Not violating the bond of like to like.'


He spoke and ceased:  the lily maid Elaine,

Won by the mellow voice before she looked,

Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.

The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,

In battle with the love he bare his lord,

Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.

Another sinning on such heights with one,

The flower of all the west and all the world,

Had been the sleeker for it:  but in him

His mood was often like a fiend, and rose

And drove him into wastes and solitudes

For agony, who was yet a living soul.

Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man

That ever among ladies ate in hall,

And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.

However marred, of more than twice her years,

Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,

And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes

And loved him, with that love which was her doom.


Then the great knight, the darling of the court,

Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall

Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain

Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,

But kindly man moving among his kind:

Whom they with meats and vintage of their best

And talk and minstrel melody entertained.

And much they asked of court and Table Round,

And ever well and readily answered he:

But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,

Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,

Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,

The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.

'He learnt and warned me of their fierce design

Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;

But I, my sons, and little daughter fled

From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods

By the great river in a boatman's hut.

Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke

The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill.'


'O there, great lord, doubtless,' Lavaine said, rapt

By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth

Toward greatness in its elder, 'you have fought.

O tell us--for we live apart--you know

Of Arthur's glorious wars.'  And Lancelot spoke

And answered him at full, as having been

With Arthur in the fight which all day long

Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;

And in the four loud battles by the shore

Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war

That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts

Of Celidon the forest; and again

By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King

Had on his cuirass worn our Lady's Head,

Carved of one emerald centered in a sun

Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;

And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,

When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse

Set every gilded parapet shuddering;

And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,

And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,

Where many a heathen fell; 'and on the mount

Of Badon I myself beheld the King

Charge at the head of all his Table Round,

And all his legions crying Christ and him,

And break them; and I saw him, after, stand

High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume

Red as the rising sun with heathen blood,

And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,

"They are broken, they are broken!" for the King,

However mild he seems at home, nor cares

For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts--

For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs

Saying, his knights are better men than he--

Yet in this heathen war the fire of God

Fills him:  I never saw his like:  there lives

No greater leader.'


                  While he uttered this,

Low to her own heart said the lily maid,

'Save your own great self, fair lord;' and when he fell

From talk of war to traits of pleasantry--

Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind--

She still took note that when the living smile

Died from his lips, across him came a cloud

Of melancholy severe, from which again,

Whenever in her hovering to and fro

The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,

There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness

Of manners and of nature:  and she thought

That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.

And all night long his face before her lived,

As when a painter, poring on a face,

Divinely through all hindrance finds the man

Behind it, and so paints him that his face,

The shape and colour of a mind and life,

Lives for his children, ever at its best

And fullest; so the face before her lived,

Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full

Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.

Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought

She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.

First in fear, step after step, she stole

Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:

Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,

'This shield, my friend, where is it?' and Lavaine

Past inward, as she came from out the tower.

There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed

The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.

Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew

Nearer and stood.  He looked, and more amazed

Than if seven men had set upon him, saw

The maiden standing in the dewy light.

He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.

Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,

For silent, though he greeted her, she stood

Rapt on his face as if it were a God's.

Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,

That he should wear her favour at the tilt.

She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.

'Fair lord, whose name I know not--noble it is,

I well believe, the noblest--will you wear

My favour at this tourney?'  'Nay,' said he,

'Fair lady, since I never yet have worn

Favour of any lady in the lists.

Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know.'

'Yea, so,' she answered; 'then in wearing mine

Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,

That those who know should know you.'  And he turned

Her counsel up and down within his mind,

And found it true, and answered, 'True, my child.

Well, I will wear it:  fetch it out to me:

What is it?' and she told him 'A red sleeve

Broidered with pearls,' and brought it:  then he bound

Her token on his helmet, with a smile

Saying, 'I never yet have done so much

For any maiden living,' and the blood

Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;

But left her all the paler, when Lavaine

Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,

His brother's; which he gave to Lancelot,

Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:

'Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield

In keeping till I come.'  'A grace to me,'

She answered, 'twice today.  I am your squire!'

Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, 'Lily maid,

For fear our people call you lily maid

In earnest, let me bring your colour back;

Once, twice, and thrice:  now get you hence to bed:'

So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,

And thus they moved away:  she stayed a minute,

Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there--

Her bright hair blown about the serious face

Yet rosy-kindled with her brother's kiss--

Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield

In silence, while she watched their arms far-off

Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.

Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield,

There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.


Meanwhile the new companions past away

Far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs,

To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight

Not far from Camelot, now for forty years

A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,

And ever labouring had scooped himself

In the white rock a chapel and a hall

On massive columns, like a shorecliff cave,

And cells and chambers:  all were fair and dry;

The green light from the meadows underneath

Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;

And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees

And poplars made a noise of falling showers.

And thither wending there that night they bode.


But when the next day broke from underground,

And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,

They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:

Then Lancelot saying, 'Hear, but hold my name

Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,'

Abashed young Lavaine, whose instant reverence,

Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,

But left him leave to stammer, 'Is it indeed?'

And after muttering 'The great Lancelot,

At last he got his breath and answered, 'One,

One have I seen--that other, our liege lord,

The dread Pendragon, Britain's King of kings,

Of whom the people talk mysteriously,

He will be there--then were I stricken blind

That minute, I might say that I had seen.'


So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists

By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes

Run through the peopled gallery which half round

Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,

Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat

Robed in red samite, easily to be known,

Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,

And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,

And from the carven-work behind him crept

Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make

Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them

Through knots and loops and folds innumerable

Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found

The new design wherein they lost themselves,

Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:

And, in the costly canopy o'er him set,

Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.


Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,

'Me you call great:  mine is the firmer seat,

The truer lance:  but there is many a youth

Now crescent, who will come to all I am

And overcome it; and in me there dwells

No greatness, save it be some far-off touch

Of greatness to know well I am not great:

There is the man.'  And Lavaine gaped upon him

As on a thing miraculous, and anon

The trumpets blew; and then did either side,

They that assailed, and they that held the lists,

Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,

Meet in the midst, and there so furiously

Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,

If any man that day were left afield,

The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.

And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw

Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it

Against the stronger:  little need to speak

Of Lancelot in his glory!  King, duke, earl,

Count, baron--whom he smote, he overthrew.


But in the field were Lancelot's kith and kin,

Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,

Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight

Should do and almost overdo the deeds

Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, 'Lo!

What is he?  I do not mean the force alone--

The grace and versatility of the man!

Is it not Lancelot?'  'When has Lancelot worn

Favour of any lady in the lists?

Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know.'

'How then? who then?' a fury seized them all,

A fiery family passion for the name

Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.

They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,

Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made

In moving, all together down upon him

Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,

Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all

Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,

Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,

And him that helms it, so they overbore

Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear

Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear

Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head

Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.


Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;

He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,

And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.

He up the side, sweating with agony, got,

But thought to do while he might yet endure,

And being lustily holpen by the rest,

His party,--though it seemed half-miracle

To those he fought with,--drave his kith and kin,

And all the Table Round that held the lists,

Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew

Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve

Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,

His party, cried 'Advance and take thy prize

The diamond;' but he answered, 'Diamond me

No diamonds! for God's love, a little air!

Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!

Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not.'


He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field

With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.

There from his charger down he slid, and sat,

Gasping to Sir Lavaine, 'Draw the lance-head:'

'Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot,' said Lavaine,

'I dread me, if I draw it, you will die.'

But he, 'I die already with it:  draw--

Draw,'--and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave

A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,

And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank

For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.

Then came the hermit out and bare him in,

There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt

Whether to live or die, for many a week

Hid from the wide world's rumour by the grove

Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,

And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.


But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,

His party, knights of utmost North and West,

Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,

Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,

'Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,

Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize

Untaken, crying that his prize is death.'

'Heaven hinder,' said the King, 'that such an one,

So great a knight as we have seen today--

He seemed to me another Lancelot--

Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot--

He must not pass uncared for.  Wherefore, rise,

O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.

Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.

I charge you that you get at once to horse.

And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you

Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:

His prowess was too wondrous.  We will do him

No customary honour:  since the knight

Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,

Ourselves will send it after.  Rise and take

This diamond, and deliver it, and return,

And bring us where he is, and how he fares,

And cease not from your quest until ye find.'


So saying, from the carven flower above,

To which it made a restless heart, he took,

And gave, the diamond:  then from where he sat

At Arthur's right, with smiling face arose,

With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince

In the mid might and flourish of his May,

Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,

And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint

And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal

Sir Modred's brother, and the child of Lot,

Nor often loyal to his word, and now

Wroth that the King's command to sally forth

In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave

The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.


So all in wrath he got to horse and went;

While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,

Past, thinking 'Is it Lancelot who hath come

Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain

Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,

And ridden away to die?'  So feared the King,

And, after two days' tarriance there, returned.

Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,

'Love, are you yet so sick?'  'Nay, lord,' she said.

'And where is Lancelot?'  Then the Queen amazed,

'Was he not with you? won he not your prize?'

'Nay, but one like him.'  'Why that like was he.'

And when the King demanded how she knew,

Said, 'Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,

Than Lancelot told me of a common talk

That men went down before his spear at a touch,

But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name

Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name

From all men, even the King, and to this end

Had made a pretext of a hindering wound,

That he might joust unknown of all, and learn

If his old prowess were in aught decayed;

And added, "Our true Arthur, when he learns,

Will well allow me pretext, as for gain

Of purer glory."'


                Then replied the King:

'Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,

In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,

To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.

Surely his King and most familiar friend

Might well have kept his secret.  True, indeed,

Albeit I know my knights fantastical,

So fine a fear in our large Lancelot

Must needs have moved my laughter:  now remains

But little cause for laughter:  his own kin--

Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!--

His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;

So that he went sore wounded from the field:

Yet good news too:  for goodly hopes are mine

That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.

He wore, against his wont, upon his helm

A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,

Some gentle maiden's gift.'


                          'Yea, lord,' she said,

'Thy hopes are mine,' and saying that, she choked,

And sharply turned about to hide her face,

Past to her chamber, and there flung herself

Down on the great King's couch, and writhed upon it,

And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,

And shrieked out 'Traitor' to the unhearing wall,

Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,

And moved about her palace, proud and pale.


Gawain the while through all the region round

Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,

Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,

And came at last, though late, to Astolat:

Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid

Glanced at, and cried, 'What news from Camelot, lord?

What of the knight with the red sleeve?'  'He won.'

'I knew it,' she said.  'But parted from the jousts

Hurt in the side,' whereat she caught her breath;

Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;

Thereon she smote her hand:  wellnigh she swooned:

And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came

The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince

Reported who he was, and on what quest

Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find

The victor, but had ridden a random round

To seek him, and had wearied of the search.

To whom the Lord of Astolat, 'Bide with us,

And ride no more at random, noble Prince!

Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;

This will he send or come for:  furthermore

Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,

Needs must hear.'  To this the courteous Prince

Accorded with his wonted courtesy,

Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,

And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:

Where could be found face daintier? then her shape

From forehead down to foot, perfect--again

From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:

'Well--if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!'

And oft they met among the garden yews,

And there he set himself to play upon her

With sallying wit, free flashes from a height

Above her, graces of the court, and songs,

Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence

And amorous adulation, till the maid

Rebelled against it, saying to him, 'Prince,

O loyal nephew of our noble King,

Why ask you not to see the shield he left,

Whence you might learn his name?  Why slight your King,

And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove

No surer than our falcon yesterday,

Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went

To all the winds?'  'Nay, by mine head,' said he,

'I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,

O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;

But an ye will it let me see the shield.'

And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw

Sir Lancelot's azure lions, crowned with gold,

Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked:

'Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!'

'And right was I,' she answered merrily, 'I,

Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all.'

'And if I dreamed,' said Gawain, 'that you love

This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!

Speak therefore:  shall I waste myself in vain?'

Full simple was her answer, 'What know I?

My brethren have been all my fellowship;

And I, when often they have talked of love,

Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,

Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself--

I know not if I know what true love is,

But if I know, then, if I love not him,

I know there is none other I can love.'

'Yea, by God's death,' said he, 'ye love him well,

But would not, knew ye what all others know,

And whom he loves.'  'So be it,' cried Elaine,

And lifted her fair face and moved away:

But he pursued her, calling, 'Stay a little!

One golden minute's grace! he wore your sleeve:

Would he break faith with one I may not name?

Must our true man change like a leaf at last?

Nay--like enow:  why then, far be it from me

To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!

And, damsel, for I deem you know full well

Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave

My quest with you; the diamond also:  here!

For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;

And if he love, it will be sweet to have it

From your own hand; and whether he love or not,

A diamond is a diamond.  Fare you well

A thousand times!--a thousand times farewell!

Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two

May meet at court hereafter:  there, I think,

So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,

We two shall know each other.'


                             Then he gave,

And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,

The diamond, and all wearied of the quest

Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went

A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.


Thence to the court he past; there told the King

What the King knew, 'Sir Lancelot is the knight.'

And added, 'Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;

But failed to find him, though I rode all round

The region:  but I lighted on the maid

Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,

Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,

I gave the diamond:  she will render it;

For by mine head she knows his hiding-place.'


The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,

'Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more

On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget

Obedience is the courtesy due to kings.'


He spake and parted.  Wroth, but all in awe,

For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,

Lingered that other, staring after him;

Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad

About the maid of Astolat, and her love.

All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:

'The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,

Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat.'

Some read the King's face, some the Queen's, and all

Had marvel what the maid might be, but most

Predoomed her as unworthy.  One old dame

Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.

She, that had heard the noise of it before,

But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,

Marred her friend's aim with pale tranquillity.

So ran the tale like fire about the court,

Fire in dry stubble a nine-days' wonder flared:

Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice

Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,

And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid

Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat

With lips severely placid, felt the knot

Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen

Crushed the wild passion out against the floor

Beneath the banquet, where all the meats became

As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.


But far away the maid in Astolat,

Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept

The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,

Crept to her father, while he mused alone,

Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,

'Father, you call me wilful, and the fault

Is yours who let me have my will, and now,

Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?'

'Nay,' said he, 'surely.'  'Wherefore, let me hence,'

She answered, 'and find out our dear Lavaine.'

'Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:

Bide,' answered he:  'we needs must hear anon

Of him, and of that other.'  'Ay,' she said,

'And of that other, for I needs must hence

And find that other, wheresoe'er he be,

And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,

Lest I be found as faithless in the quest

As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.

Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams

Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,

Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden's aid.

The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,

My father, to be sweet and serviceable

To noble knights in sickness, as ye know

When these have worn their tokens:  let me hence

I pray you.'  Then her father nodding said,

'Ay, ay, the diamond:  wit ye well, my child,

Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,

Being our greatest:  yea, and you must give it--

And sure I think this fruit is hung too high

For any mouth to gape for save a queen's--

Nay, I mean nothing:  so then, get you gone,

Being so very wilful you must go.'


Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,

And while she made her ready for her ride,

Her father's latest word hummed in her ear,

'Being so very wilful you must go,'

And changed itself and echoed in her heart,

'Being so very wilful you must die.'

But she was happy enough and shook it off,

As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;

And in her heart she answered it and said,

'What matter, so I help him back to life?'

Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide

Rode o'er the long backs of the bushless downs

To Camelot, and before the city-gates

Came on her brother with a happy face

Making a roan horse caper and curvet

For pleasure all about a field of flowers:

Whom when she saw, 'Lavaine,' she cried, 'Lavaine,

How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?'  He amazed,

'Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!

How know ye my lord's name is Lancelot?'

But when the maid had told him all her tale,

Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods

Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,

Where Arthur's wars were rendered mystically,

Past up the still rich city to his kin,

His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;

And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove

Led to the caves:  there first she saw the casque

Of Lancelot on the wall:  her scarlet sleeve,

Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,

Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,

Because he had not loosed it from his helm,

But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.

And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,

His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands

Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream

Of dragging down his enemy made them move.

Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,

Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,

Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.

The sound not wonted in a place so still

Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes

Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,

'Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:'

His eyes glistened:  she fancied 'Is it for me?'

And when the maid had told him all the tale

Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest

Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt

Full lowly by the corners of his bed,

And laid the diamond in his open hand.

Her face was near, and as we kiss the child

That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.

At once she slipt like water to the floor.

'Alas,' he said, 'your ride hath wearied you.

Rest must you have.'  'No rest for me,' she said;

'Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest.'

What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,

Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,

Till all her heart's sad secret blazed itself

In the heart's colours on her simple face;

And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,

And being weak in body said no more;

But did not love the colour; woman's love,

Save one, he not regarded, and so turned

Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.


Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,

And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates

Far up the dim rich city to her kin;

There bode the night:  but woke with dawn, and past

Down through the dim rich city to the fields,

Thence to the cave:  so day by day she past

In either twilight ghost-like to and fro

Gliding, and every day she tended him,

And likewise many a night:  and Lancelot

Would, though he called his wound a little hurt

Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times

Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem

Uncourteous, even he:  but the meek maid

Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him

Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,

Milder than any mother to a sick child,

And never woman yet, since man's first fall,

Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love

Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all

The simples and the science of that time,

Told him that her fine care had saved his life.

And the sick man forgot her simple blush,

Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,

Would listen for her coming and regret

Her parting step, and held her tenderly,

And loved her with all love except the love

Of man and woman when they love their best,

Closest and sweetest, and had died the death

In any knightly fashion for her sake.

And peradventure had he seen her first

She might have made this and that other world

Another world for the sick man; but now

The shackles of an old love straitened him,

His honour rooted in dishonour stood,

And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.


Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made

Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.

These, as but born of sickness, could not live:

For when the blood ran lustier in him again,

Full often the bright image of one face,

Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,

Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.

Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace

Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,

Or short and coldly, and she knew right well

What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant

She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,

And drave her ere her time across the fields

Far into the rich city, where alone

She murmured, 'Vain, in vain:  it cannot be.

He will not love me:  how then? must I die?'

Then as a little helpless innocent bird,

That has but one plain passage of few notes,

Will sing the simple passage o'er and o'er

For all an April morning, till the ear

Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid

Went half the night repeating, 'Must I die?'

And now to right she turned, and now to left,

And found no ease in turning or in rest;

And 'Him or death,' she muttered, 'death or him,'

Again and like a burthen, 'Him or death.'


But when Sir Lancelot's deadly hurt was whole,

To Astolat returning rode the three.

There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self

In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,

She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought

'If I be loved, these are my festal robes,

If not, the victim's flowers before he fall.'

And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid

That she should ask some goodly gift of him

For her own self or hers; 'and do not shun

To speak the wish most near to your true heart;

Such service have ye done me, that I make

My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I

In mine own land, and what I will I can.'

Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,

But like a ghost without the power to speak.

And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,

And bode among them yet a little space

Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced

He found her in among the garden yews,

And said, 'Delay no longer, speak your wish,

Seeing I go today:' then out she brake:

'Going? and we shall never see you more.

And I must die for want of one bold word.'

'Speak:  that I live to hear,' he said, 'is yours.'

Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:

'I have gone mad.  I love you:  let me die.'

'Ah, sister,' answered Lancelot, 'what is this?'

And innocently extending her white arms,

'Your love,' she said, 'your love--to be your wife.'

And Lancelot answered, 'Had I chosen to wed,

I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:

But now there never will be wife of mine.'

'No, no,' she cried, 'I care not to be wife,

But to be with you still, to see your face,

To serve you, and to follow you through the world.'

And Lancelot answered, 'Nay, the world, the world,

All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart

To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue

To blare its own interpretation--nay,

Full ill then should I quit your brother's love,

And your good father's kindness.'  And she said,

'Not to be with you, not to see your face--

Alas for me then, my good days are done.'

'Nay, noble maid,' he answered, 'ten times nay!

This is not love:  but love's first flash in youth,

Most common:  yea, I know it of mine own self:

And you yourself will smile at your own self

Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life

To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:

And then will I, for true you are and sweet

Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,

More specially should your good knight be poor,

Endow you with broad land and territory

Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,

So that would make you happy:  furthermore,

Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,

In all your quarrels will I be your knight.

This I will do, dear damsel, for your sake,

And more than this I cannot.'


                            While he spoke

She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale

Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:

'Of all this will I nothing;' and so fell,

And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.


Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew

Their talk had pierced, her father:  'Ay, a flash,

I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.

Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.

I pray you, use some rough discourtesy

To blunt or break her passion.'                              

Lancelot said,

'That were against me:  what I can I will;'

And there that day remained, and toward even

Sent for his shield:  full meekly rose the maid,

Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;

Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,

Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked

Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.

And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;

And she by tact of love was well aware

That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.

And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,

Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.

This was the one discourtesy that he used.


So in her tower alone the maiden sat:

His very shield was gone; only the case,

Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.

But still she heard him, still his picture formed

And grew between her and the pictured wall.

Then came her father, saying in low tones,

'Have comfort,' whom she greeted quietly.

Then came her brethren saying, 'Peace to thee,

Sweet sister,' whom she answered with all calm.

But when they left her to herself again,

Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field

Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls

Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt

Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms

Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.


And in those days she made a little song,

And called her song 'The Song of Love and Death,'

And sang it:  sweetly could she make and sing.


'Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;

And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:

I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.


'Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:

Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.

O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.


'Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,

Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,

I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.


'I fain would follow love, if that could be;

I needs must follow death, who calls for me;

Call and I follow, I follow! let me die.'


High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,

All in a fiery dawning wild with wind

That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought

With shuddering, 'Hark the Phantom of the house

That ever shrieks before a death,' and called

The father, and all three in hurry and fear

Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn

Flared on her face, she shrilling, 'Let me die!'


As when we dwell upon a word we know,

Repeating, till the word we know so well

Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,

So dwelt the father on her face, and thought

'Is this Elaine?' till back the maiden fell,

Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,

Speaking a still good-morrow with her eyes.

At last she said, 'Sweet brothers, yesternight

I seemed a curious little maid again,

As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,

And when ye used to take me with the flood

Up the great river in the boatman's boat.

Only ye would not pass beyond the cape

That has the poplar on it:  there ye fixt

Your limit, oft returning with the tide.

And yet I cried because ye would not pass

Beyond it, and far up the shining flood

Until we found the palace of the King.

And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed

That I was all alone upon the flood,

And then I said, "Now shall I have my will:"

And there I woke, but still the wish remained.

So let me hence that I may pass at last

Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,

Until I find the palace of the King.

There will I enter in among them all,

And no man there will dare to mock at me;

But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,

And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;

Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,

Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:

And there the King will know me and my love,

And there the Queen herself will pity me,

And all the gentle court will welcome me,

And after my long voyage I shall rest!'


'Peace,' said her father, 'O my child, ye seem

Light-headed, for what force is yours to go

So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look

On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?'


Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,

And bluster into stormy sobs and say,

'I never loved him:  an I meet with him,

I care not howsoever great he be,

Then will I strike at him and strike him down,

Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,

For this discomfort he hath done the house.'


To whom the gentle sister made reply,

'Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,

Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot's fault

Not to love me, than it is mine to love

Him of all men who seems to me the highest.'


'Highest?' the father answered, echoing 'highest?'

(He meant to break the passion in her) 'nay,

Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;

But this I know, for all the people know it,

He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:

And she returns his love in open shame;

If this be high, what is it to be low?'


Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:

'Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I

For anger:  these are slanders:  never yet

Was noble man but made ignoble talk.

He makes no friend who never made a foe.

But now it is my glory to have loved

One peerless, without stain:  so let me pass,

My father, howsoe'er I seem to you,

Not all unhappy, having loved God's best

And greatest, though my love had no return:

Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,

Thanks, but you work against your own desire;

For if I could believe the things you say

I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,

Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man

Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die.'


So when the ghostly man had come and gone,

She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,

Besought Lavaine to write as she devised

A letter, word for word; and when he asked

'Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?

Then will I bear it gladly;' she replied,

'For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,

But I myself must bear it.'  Then he wrote

The letter she devised; which being writ

And folded, 'O sweet father, tender and true,

Deny me not,' she said--'ye never yet

Denied my fancies--this, however strange,

My latest:  lay the letter in my hand

A little ere I die, and close the hand

Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.

And when the heat is gone from out my heart,

Then take the little bed on which I died

For Lancelot's love, and deck it like the Queen's

For richness, and me also like the Queen

In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.

And let there be prepared a chariot-bier

To take me to the river, and a barge

Be ready on the river, clothed in black.

I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.

There surely I shall speak for mine own self,

And none of you can speak for me so well.

And therefore let our dumb old man alone

Go with me, he can steer and row, and he

Will guide me to that palace, to the doors.'


She ceased:  her father promised; whereupon

She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death

Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.

But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh

Her father laid the letter in her hand,

And closed the hand upon it, and she died.

So that day there was dole in Astolat.


But when the next sun brake from underground,

Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows

Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier

Past like a shadow through the field, that shone

Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,

Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.

There sat the lifelong creature of the house,

Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,

Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.

So those two brethren from the chariot took

And on the black decks laid her in her bed,

Set in her hand a lily, o'er her hung

The silken case with braided blazonings,

And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her

'Sister, farewell for ever,' and again

'Farewell, sweet sister,' parted all in tears.

Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,

Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood--

In her right hand the lily, in her left

The letter--all her bright hair streaming down--

And all the coverlid was cloth of gold

Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white

All but her face, and that clear-featured face

Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,

But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.


That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved

Audience of Guinevere, to give at last,

The price of half a realm, his costly gift,

Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,

With deaths of others, and almost his own,

The nine-years-fought-for diamonds:  for he saw

One of her house, and sent him to the Queen

Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed

With such and so unmoved a majesty

She might have seemed her statue, but that he,

Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet

For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye

The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,

In the Queen's shadow, vibrate on the walls,

And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.


All in an oriel on the summer side,

Vine-clad, of Arthur's palace toward the stream,

They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, 'Queen,

Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,

Take, what I had not won except for you,

These jewels, and make me happy, making them

An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,

Or necklace for a neck to which the swan's

Is tawnier than her cygnet's:  these are words:

Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin

In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it

Words, as we grant grief tears.  Such sin in words

Perchance, we both can pardon:  but, my Queen,

I hear of rumours flying through your court.

Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,

Should have in it an absoluter trust

To make up that defect:  let rumours be:

When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust

That you trust me in your own nobleness,

I may not well believe that you believe.'


While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen

Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine

Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,

Till all the place whereon she stood was green;

Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand

Received at once and laid aside the gems

There on a table near her, and replied:


'It may be, I am quicker of belief

Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.

Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.

This good is in it, whatsoe'er of ill,

It can be broken easier.  I for you

This many a year have done despite and wrong

To one whom ever in my heart of hearts

I did acknowledge nobler.  What are these?

Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth

Being your gift, had you not lost your own.

To loyal hearts the value of all gifts

Must vary as the giver's.  Not for me!

For her! for your new fancy.  Only this

Grant me, I pray you:  have your joys apart.

I doubt not that however changed, you keep

So much of what is graceful:  and myself

Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy

In which as Arthur's Queen I move and rule:

So cannot speak my mind.  An end to this!

A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.

So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;

Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:

An armlet for an arm to which the Queen's

Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck

O as much fairer--as a faith once fair

Was richer than these diamonds--hers not mine--

Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,

Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will--

She shall not have them.'                         Saying which

she seized,

And, through the casement standing wide for heat,

Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream.

Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,

Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.

Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain

At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,

Close underneath his eyes, and right across

Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge.

Whereon the lily maid of Astolat

Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.


But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away

To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,

On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.

There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom,

All up the marble stair, tier over tier,

Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked

'What is it?' but that oarsman's haggard face,

As hard and still as is the face that men

Shape to their fancy's eye from broken rocks

On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said

'He is enchanted, cannot speak--and she,

Look how she sleeps--the Fairy Queen, so fair!

Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?

Or come to take the King to Fairyland?

For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,

But that he passes into Fairyland.'


While thus they babbled of the King, the King

Came girt with knights:  then turned the tongueless man

From the half-face to the full eye, and rose

And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.

So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale

And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;

And reverently they bore her into hall.

Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,

And Lancelot later came and mused at her,

And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:

But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,

Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:


'Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,

I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,

Come, for you left me taking no farewell,

Hither, to take my last farewell of you.

I loved you, and my love had no return,

And therefore my true love has been my death.

And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,

And to all other ladies, I make moan:

Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.

Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,

As thou art a knight peerless.'


                              Thus he read;

And ever in the reading, lords and dames

Wept, looking often from his face who read

To hers which lay so silent, and at times,

So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,

Who had devised the letter, moved again.


Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:

'My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,

Know that for this most gentle maiden's death

Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,

But loved me with a love beyond all love

In women, whomsoever I have known.

Yet to be loved makes not to love again;

Not at my years, however it hold in youth.

I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave

No cause, not willingly, for such a love:

To this I call my friends in testimony,

Her brethren, and her father, who himself

Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,

To break her passion, some discourtesy

Against my nature:  what I could, I did.

I left her and I bad her no farewell;

Though, had I dreamt the damsel would have died,

I might have put my wits to some rough use,

And helped her from herself.'


                            Then said the Queen

(Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)

'Ye might at least have done her so much grace,

Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death.'

He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,

He adding,

         'Queen, she would not be content

Save that I wedded her, which could not be.

Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;

It could not be.  I told her that her love

Was but the flash of youth, would darken down

To rise hereafter in a stiller flame

Toward one more worthy of her--then would I,

More specially were he, she wedded, poor,

Estate them with large land and territory

In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,

To keep them in all joyance:  more than this

I could not; this she would not, and she died.'


He pausing, Arthur answered, 'O my knight,

It will be to thy worship, as my knight,

And mine, as head of all our Table Round,

To see that she be buried worshipfully.'


So toward that shrine which then in all the realm

Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went

The marshalled Order of their Table Round,

And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see

The maiden buried, not as one unknown,

Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,

And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.

And when the knights had laid her comely head

Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,

Then Arthur spake among them, 'Let her tomb

Be costly, and her image thereupon,

And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet

Be carven, and her lily in her hand.

And let the story of her dolorous voyage

For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb

In letters gold and azure!' which was wrought

Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames

And people, from the high door streaming, brake

Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,

Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,

Drew near, and sighed in passing, 'Lancelot,

Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love.'

He answered with his eyes upon the ground,

'That is love's curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven.'

But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,

Approached him, and with full affection said,


'Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have

Most joy and most affiance, for I know

What thou hast been in battle by my side,

And many a time have watched thee at the tilt

Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,

And let the younger and unskilled go by

To win his honour and to make his name,

And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man

Made to be loved; but now I would to God,

Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,

Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,

By God for thee alone, and from her face,

If one may judge the living by the dead,

Delicately pure and marvellously fair,

Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man

Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons

Born to the glory of thine name and fame,

My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake.'


Then answered Lancelot, 'Fair she was, my King,

Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.

To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,

To doubt her pureness were to want a heart--

Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love

Could bind him, but free love will not be bound.'


'Free love, so bound, were frest,' said the King.

'Let love be free; free love is for the best:

And, after heaven, on our dull side of death,

What should be best, if not so pure a love

Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee

She failed to bind, though being, as I think,

Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.'


And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,

And at the inrunning of a little brook

Sat by the river in a cove, and watched

The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes

And saw the barge that brought her moving down,

Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said

Low in himself, 'Ah simple heart and sweet,

Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love

Far tenderer than my Queen's.  Pray for thy soul?

Ay, that will I.  Farewell too--now at last--

Farewell, fair lily.  "Jealousy in love?"

Not rather dead love's harsh heir, jealous pride?

Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,

May not your crescent fear for name and fame

Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?

Why did the King dwell on my name to me?

Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,

Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake

Caught from his mother's arms--the wondrous one

Who passes through the vision of the night--

She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns

Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn

She kissed me saying, "Thou art fair, my child,

As a king's son," and often in her arms

She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.

Would she had drowned me in it, where'er it be!

For what am I? what profits me my name

Of greatest knight?  I fought for it, and have it:

Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;

Now grown a part of me:  but what use in it?

To make men worse by making my sin known?

Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?

Alas for Arthur's greatest knight, a man

Not after Arthur's heart!  My needs must break

These bonds that so defame me:  not without

She wills it: would I, if she willed it? nay,

Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,

I pray him, send a sudden Angel down

To seize me by the hair and bear me far,

And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,

Among the tumbled fragments of the hills.'


So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,

Not knowing he should die a holy man.

Poem 82: Late, Late, So Late

Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!

Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.

Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.

    No light had we: for that we do repent;

And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.

Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.

    No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!

O, let us in, that we may find the light!

Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.


   Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?

O, let us in, tho' late, to kiss his feet!

No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now."

Poem 83: Lilian

I


  Airy, Fairy Lilian,

  Flitting, fairy Lilian,

When I ask her if she love me,

Claps her tiny hands above me,

   Laughing all she can;

She 'll not tell me if she love me,

   Cruel little Lilian.



II


       When my passion seeks

       Pleasance in love-sighs,

   She, looking thro' and thro' me

   Thoroughly to undo me,

       Smiling, never speaks:

So innocent-arch, so cunning-simple,

From beneath her gathered wimple

 Glancing with black-bearded eyes,

Till the lightning laughters dimple

       The baby-roses in her cheeks;

       Then away she flies.



III


 Prythee weep, May Lilian!

    Gaiety without eclipse

 Whearieth me, May Lilian;

Thro' my every heart it thrilleth

 When from crimson-threaded lips

Silver-treble laughter trilleth:

 Prythee weep, May Lilian!



IV


      Praying all I can,

If prayers will not hush thee,

      Airy Lilian,

Like a rose-leaf I will crush thee,

      Fairy Lilian.

Poem 84: Locksley Hall

Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn:

 Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn.


 'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,

 Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;


 Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,

 And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.


 Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,

 Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.


 Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,

 Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.


 Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime

 With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;


 When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;

 When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:


 When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;

 Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.--


 In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;

 In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;


 In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;

 In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.


 Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,

 And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.


 And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,

 Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."


 On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,

 As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.


 And she turn'd--her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs--

 All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes--


 Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong";

 Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long."


 Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;

 Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.


 Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;

 Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.


 Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,

 And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.


 Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,

 And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.


 O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!

 O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!


 Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,

 Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!


 Is it well to wish thee happy?--having known me--to decline

 On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!


 Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by day,

 What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.


 As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,

 And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.


 He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,

 Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.


 What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with wine.

 Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in thine.


 It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:

 Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.


 He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand--

 Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!


 Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,

 Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.


 Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!

 Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!


 Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!

 Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!


 Well--'t is well that I should bluster!--Hadst thou less unworthy proved--

 Would to God--for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.


 Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?

 I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.


 Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come

 As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.


 Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?

 Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?


 I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and move;

 Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.


 Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?

 No--she never loved me truly; love is love for evermore.


 Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,

 That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.


 Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,

 In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.


 Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,

 Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.


 Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,

 To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.


 Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom years,

 And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;


 And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.

 Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again.


 Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry.

 'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry.


 Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest.

 Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.


 O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.

 Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.


 O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,

 With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.


 "They were dangerous guides the feelings--she herself was not exempt--

 Truly, she herself had suffer'd"--Perish in thy self-contempt!


 Overlive it--lower yet--be happy! wherefore should I care?

 I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.


 What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?

 Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.


 Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.

 I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do?


 I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,

 When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.


 But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,

 And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.


 Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.

 Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!


 Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,

 When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;


 Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,

 Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,


 And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,

 Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;


 And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,

 Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men:


 Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:

 That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:


 For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,

 Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;


 Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,

 Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;


 Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew

 From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;


 Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,

 With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;


 Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd

 In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.


 There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,

 And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.


 So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,

 Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;


 Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint:

 Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point:


 Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,

 Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.


 Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,

 And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.


 What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,

 Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?


 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,

 And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.


 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,

 Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.


 Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,

 They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:


 Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?

 I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.


 Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain--

 Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:


 Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,

 Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine--


 Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat

 Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;


 Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,--

 I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.


 Or to burst all links of habit--there to wander far away,

 On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.


 Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,

 Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.


 Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,

 Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;


 Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree--

 Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.


 There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,

 In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.


 There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing space;

 I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.


 Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,

 Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;


 Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks,

 Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books--


 Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild,

 But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.


 I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains,

 Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!


 Mated with a squalid savage--what to me were sun or clime?

 I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time--


 I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,

 Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!


 Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,

 Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.


 Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;

 Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.


 Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:

 Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun.


 O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.

 Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.


 Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!

 Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.


 Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,

 Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.


 Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;

 For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.

Poem 85: Lucretius

Lucilla, wedded to Lucretius, found

         Her master cold; for when the morning flush

         Of passion and the first embrace had died

         Between them, tho' he loved her none the less,

         Yet often when the woman heard his foot

         Return from pacings in the field, and ran

         To greet him with a kiss, the master took

         Small notice, or austerely, for his mind

         Half buried in some weightier argument,

         Or fancy-borne perhaps upon the rise

         And long roll of the hexameter -- he past

         To turn and ponder those three hundred scrolls

         Left by the Teacher, whom he held divine.

         She brook'd it not, but wrathful, petulant

         Dreaming some rival, sought and found a witch

         Who brew'd the philtre which had power, they said

         To lead an errant passion home again.

         And this, at times, she mingled with his drink,

         And this destroy'd him; for the wicked broth

         Confused the chemic labor of the blood,

         And tickling the brute brain within the man's

         Made havoc among those tender cells, and check'd

         His power to shape. He loathed himself, and once

         After a tempest woke upon a morn

         That mock'd him with returning calm, and cried:


         "Storm in the night! for thrice I heard the rain

         Rushing; and once the flash of a thunderbolt --

         Methought I never saw so fierce a fork --

         Struck out the streaming mountain-side, and show'd

         A riotous confluence of watercourses

         Blanching and billowing in a hollow of it,

         Where all but yester-eve was dusty-dry.


         "Storm, and what dreams, ye holy Gods, what dreams!

         For thrice I waken'd after dreams. Perchance

         We do but recollect the dreams that come

         Just ere the waking. Terrible: for it seem'd

         A void was made in Nature, all her bonds

         Crack'd; and I saw the flaring atom-streams

         And torrents of her myriad universe,

         Ruining along the illimitable inane,

         Fly on to clash together again, and make

         Another and another frame of things

         For ever. That was mine, my dream, I knew it --

         Of and belonging to me, as the dog

         With inward yelp and restless forefoot plies

         His function of the woodland; but the next!

         I thought that all the blood by Sylla shed

         Came driving rainlike down again on earth,

         And where it dash'd the reddening meadow, sprang

         No dragon warriors from Cadmean teeth,

         For these I thought my dream would show to me,

         But girls, Hetairai, curious in their art,

         Hired animalisms, vile as those that made

         The mulberry-faced Dictator's orgies worse

         Than aught they fable of the quiet Gods.

         And hands they mixt, and yell'd and round me drove

         In narrowing circles till I yell'd again

         Half-suffocated, and sprang up, and saw --

         Was it the first beam of my latest day?


         "Then, then, from utter gloom stood out the

         The breasts of Helen, and hoveringly a sword

         Now over and now under, now direct,

         Pointed itself to pierce, but sank down shamed

         At all that beauty; and as I stared, a fire,

         The fire that left a roofless Ilion,

         Shot out of them, and scorch'd me that I woke.


         "Is this thy vengeance, holy Venus, thine,

         Because I would not one of thine own doves,

         Not even a rose, were offered to thee? thine,

         Forgetful how my rich proemion makes

         Thy glory fly along the Italian field,

         In lays that will outlast thy deity?


         "Deity? nay, thy worshippers. My tongue

         Trips, or I speak profanely. Which of these

         Angers thee most, or angers thee at all?

         Not if thou be'st of those who, far aloof

         From envy, hate and pity, and spite and scorn,

         Live the great life which all our greatest fain

         Would follow, centred in eternal calm.


         "Nay, if thou canst,

         Goddess, like ourselves

         Touch, and be touch'd, then would I cry to thee

         To kiss thy Mavors, roll thy tender arms

         Round him, and keep him from the lust of blood

         That makes a steaming slaughter-house of Rome.


         "Ay, but I meant not thee; I meant riot her

         Whom all the pines of Ida shook to see

         Slide from that quiet heaven of hers, and tempt

         The Trojan, while his neatherds were abroad

         Nor her that o'er her wounded hunter wept

         Her deity false in human-amorous tears;

         Nor whom her beardless apple-arbiter

         Decided fairest. Rather, O ye Gods,

         Poet-like, as the great Sicilian called

         Calliope to grace his golden verse --

         Ay, and this Kypris also -- did I take

         That popular name of thine to shadow forth

         The all-generating powers and genial heat

         Of Nature, when she strikes thro' the thick blood

         Of cattle, and light is large, and lambs are glad

         Nosing the mother's udder, and the bird

         Makes his heart voice amid the blaze of flowers;

         Which things appear the work of mighty Gods.


         "The Gods! and if I go my work is left

         Unfinish'd -- if I go. The Gods, who haunt

         The lucid interspace of world and world,

         Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,

         Nor ever falls the least white star of mow

         Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,

         Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar

         Their sacred everlasting calm! and such,

         Not all so fine, nor so divine a calm

         Not such, nor all unlike it, man may gain

         Letting his own life go. The Gods, the Godsl

         If all be atoms, how then should the Gods

         Being atomic not be dissoluble,

         Not follow the great law? My master held

         That Gods there are, for all men so believe.

         I prest my footsteps into his, and meant

         Surely to lead my Memmius in a train

         Of fiowery clauses onward to the proof

         That Gods there are, and deathless. Meant? I meant?

         I have forgotten what I meant, my mind

         Stumbles, and all my faculties are lamed.


         "Look where another of our Gods, the Sun

         Apollo, Delius, or of older use

         All-seeing Hyperion -- what you will --

         Has mounted yonder; since he never sware,

         Except his wrath were wreak'd on wretched man,

         That he would only shine among the dead

         Hereafter -- tales! for never yet on earth

         Could dead flesh creep, or bits of roasting ox

         Moan round the spit -- nor knows he what he sees;

         King of the East altho' he seem, and girt

         With song and flame and fragrance, slowly lifts

         His golden feet on those empurpled stairs

         That climb into the windy halls of heaven

         And here he glances on an eye new-born,

         And gets for greeting but a wail of pain;

         And here he stays upon a freezing orb

         That fain would gaze upon him to the last;

         And here upon a yellow eyelid fallen

         And closed by those who mourn a friend in vain,

         Not thankful that his troubles are no more.

         And me, altho' his fire is on my face

         Blinding, he sees not, nor at all can tell

         Whether I mean this day to end myself.

         Or lend an ear to Plato where he says,

         That men like soldiers may not quit the post

         Allotted by the Gods. But he that holds

         The Gods are careless, wherefore need he care

         Greatly for them, nor rather plunge at once,

         Being troubled, wholly out of sight, and sink

         Past earthquake -- ay, and gout and stone, that break

         Body toward death, and palsy, death-in-life,

         And wretched age -- and worst disease of all,

         These prodigies of myriad nakednesses,

         And twisted shapes of lust, unspeakable,

         Abominable, strangers at my hearth

         Not welcome, harpies miring every dish,

         The phantom husks of something foully done,

         And fleeting thro' the boundless universe,

         And blasting the long quiet of my breast

         With animal heat and dire insanity?


         "How should the mind, except it loved them, clasp

         These idols to herself? or do they fly

         Now thinner, and now thicker, like the flakes

         In a fall of snow, and so press in, perforce

         Of multitude, as crowds that in an hour

         Of civic tumult jam the doors, and bear

         The keepers down, and throng, their rags and the

         The basest, far into that council-hall

         Where sit the best and stateliest of the land?


         ³Can I not fling this horror off me again,

         Seeing with how great ease Nature can smile

         Balmier and nobler from her bath of storm,

         At random ravage? and how easily

         The mountain there has cast his cloudy slough,

         Now towering o'er him in serenest air,

         A mountain o'er a mountain, -- ay, and within

         All hollow as the hopes and fears of men?


         "But who was he that in the garden snared

         Picus and Faunus, rustic Gods? a tale

         To laugh at -- more to laugh at in myself --

         For look! what is it? there? yon arbutus

         Totters; a noiseless riot underneath

         Strikes through the wood, sets all the tops quivering -- ;

         And here an Oread -- how the sun delights

         And rosy knees and supple roundedness,

         And budded bosom-peaks -- who this way runs

         Twy-natured is no nature. Yet he draws

         Nearer and nearer, and I scan him now

         Beastlier than any phantom of his kind

         That ever butted his rough brother-brute

         For lust or lusty blood or provender.

         I hate, abhor, spit, sicken at him; and she

         Loathes him as well; such a precipitate heel,

         Fledged as it were with Mercury's ankle-wing,

         Whirls her to me -- ;but will she fling herself

         Shameless upon me? Catch her, goatfoot! nay,

         Hide, hide them, million-myrtled wilderness,


         And cavern-shadowing laurels, hide! do I wish --

         What? -- ;that the bush were leafless? or to whelm

         All of them in one massacre? O ye Gods

         I know you careless, yet, behold, to you

         From childly wont and ancient use I call --

         I thought I lived securely as yourselves --

         No lewdness, narrowing envy, monkey-spite,

         No madness of ambition, avarice, none;

         No larger feast than under plane or pine

         With neighbors laid along the grass, to take

         Only such cups as left us friendly-warm,

         Affirming each his own philosophy

         Nothing to mar the sober majesties

         Of settled, sweet, Epicurean life.

         But now it seems some unseen monster lays

         His vast and filthy hands upon my will,

         Wrenching it backward into his, and spoils

         My bliss in being; and it was not great,

         For save when shutting reasons up in rhythm,

         Or Heliconian honey in living words,

         To make a truth less harsh, I often grew

         Tired of so much within our little life

         Or of so little in our little life --

         Poor little life that toddles half an hour

         Crown'd with a flower or two, and there an end --

         And since the nobler pleasure seems to fade,

         Why should I, beastlike as I find myself,

         Not manlike end myself? -- our privilege -- ;

         What beast has heart to do it? And what man

         What Roman would be dragg'd in triumph thus?

         Not I; not he, who bears one name with her

         Whose death-blow struck the dateless doom of kings,

         When, brooking not the Tarquin in her veins,

         She made her blood in sight of Collatine

         And all his peers, flushing the guiltless air,

         Spout from the maiden fountain in her heart.

         And from it sprang the Commonwealth, which breaks

         As I am breaking now!


           "And therefore now

         Let her, that is the womb and tomb of all

         Great Nature, take, and forcing far apart

         Those blind beginnings that have made me man,

         Dash them anew together at her will

         Thro' all her cycles -- into man once more,

         Or beast or bird or fish, or opulent flower.

         But till this cosmic order everywhere

         Shatter'd into one earthquake m one day

         Cracks all to pieces, -- and that hour perhaps

         Is not so far when momentary man

         Shall seem no more a something to himself,

         But he, his hopes and hates, his homes and fanes

         And even his bones long laid within the grave,

         The very sides of the grave itself shall pass,

         Vanishing, atom and void, atom and void,

         Into the unseen for ever, -- till that hour,

         My golden work in which I told a truth

         That stays the rolling Ixionian wheel,

         And numbs the Fury's ringlet-snake, and plucks

         The mortal soul from out immortal hell

         Shall stand. Ay, surely; then it fails at last

         And perishes as I must, for O Thou

         Passionless bride, divine Tranquillity,

         Yearn'd after by the wisest of the wise

         Who fail to find thee, being as thou art

         Without one pleasure and without one pain,

         Howbeit I know thou surely must be mine

         Or soon or late, yet out of season, thus

         I woo thee roughly, for thou carest not

         How roughly men may woo thee so they win -- ;

         Thus -- thus -- the soul flies out and dies in the air


         With that he drove the knife into his side.

         She heard him raging, heard him fall, ran in,

         Beat breast, tore hair, cried out upon herself

         As having fail'd in duty to him, shriek'd

         That she but meant to win him back, fell on him

         Clasp'd, kiss'd him, wail'd. He answer'd, "Care not thou!

         Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well!"

Poem 86: LXXXIII: Spring

Dip down upon the northern shore,

O sweet new-year, delaying long;

Thou doest expectant Nature wrong,

Delaying long, delay no more.


What stays thee from the clouded noons,

Thy sweetness from its proper place?

Can trouble live with April days,

Or sadness in the summer moons?


Bring orchis, bring the fox-glove spire,

The little speedwell's darling blue,

Deep tulips dashed with fiery dew,

Laburnums, dropping-wells of fire.


O thou, new-year, delaying long,

Delayest the sorrow in my blood,

That longs to burst a frozen bud,

And flood a fresher throat with song.

Poem 87: Mariana in the Moated Grange

With blackest moss the flower-plots

Were thickly crusted, one and all:

The rusted nails fell from the knots

That held the pear to the gable-wall.

The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:

Unlifted was the clinking latch;

Weeded and worn the ancient thatch

Upon the lonely moated grange.

She only said, "My life is dreary,

He cometh not," she said;

She said, "I am aweary, aweary,

I would that I were dead!"


Her tears fell with the dews at even;

Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;

She could not look on the sweet heaven,

Either at morn or eventide.

After the flitting of the bats,

When thickest dark did trance the sky,

She drew her casement-curtain by,

And glanced athwart the glooming flats.

  She only said, "The night is dreary,

  He cometh not," she said;

  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,

  I would that I were dead!"


Upon the middle of the night,

Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:

The cock sung out an hour ere light:

From the dark fen the oxen's low

Came to her: without hope of change,

In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,

Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn

About the lonely moated grange.

  She only said, "The day is dreary,

  He cometh not," she said;

  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,

  I would that I were dead!"


About a stone-cast from the wall

A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,

And o'er it many, round and small,

The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.

Hard by a poplar shook alway,

All silver-green with gnarled bark:

For leagues no other tree did mark

The level waste, the rounding gray.

  She only said, "My life is dreary,

  He cometh not," she said;

  She said "I am aweary, aweary

  I would that I were dead!"


And ever when the moon was low,

And the shrill winds were up and away,

In the white curtain, to and fro,

She saw the gusty shadow sway.

But when the moon was very low

And wild winds bound within their cell,

The shadow of the poplar fell

Upon her bed, across her brow.

  She only said, "The night is dreary,

  He cometh not," she said;

  She said "I am aweary, aweary,

  I would that I were dead!"


All day within the dreamy house,

The doors upon their hinges creak'd;

The blue fly sung in the pane; the mouse

Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,

Or from the crevice peer'd about.

Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors

Old footsteps trod the upper floors,

Old voices called her from without.

  She only said, "My life is dreary,

  He cometh not," she said;

  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,

  I would that I were dead!"


The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,

The slow clock ticking, and the sound

Which to the wooing wind aloof

The poplar made, did all confound

Her sense; but most she loathed the hour

When the thick-moted sunbeam lay

Athwart the chambers, and the day

Was sloping toward his western bower.

  Then said she, "I am very dreary,

  He will not come," she said;

  She wept, "I am aweary, aweary,

  Oh God, that I were dead!"

Poem 88: Mariana In The South

With one black shadow at its feet,

      The house thro' all the level shines,

Close-latticed to the brooding heat,

      And silent in its dusty vines:

A faint-blue ridge upon the right,

      An empty river-bed before,

      And shallows on a distant shore,

In glaring sand and inlets bright.

          But "Aye Mary," made she moan,

              And "Aye Mary," night and morn,

          And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,

              To live forgotten, and love forlorn."


She, as her carol sadder grew,

      From brow and bosom slowly down

Thro' rosy taper fingers drew

      Her streaming curls of deepest brown

To left and right, and made appear,

      Still-lighted in a secret shrine,

      Her melancholy eyes divine,

The home of woe without a tear.

          And "Aye Mary," was her moan,

              "Madonna, sad is night and morn;"

          And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,

              To live forgotten, and love forlorn."


Till all the crimson changed, and past

      Into deep orange o'er the sea,

Low on her knees herself she cast,

      Before Our Lady murmur'd she:

Complaining, "Mother, give me grace

      To help me of my weary load."

      And on the liquid mirror glow'd

The clear perfection of her face.

          "Is this the form," she made her moan,

              "That won his praises night and morn?"

          And "Ah," she said, "but I wake alone,

              I sleep forgotten, I wake forlorn."


Nor bird would sing, nor lamb would bleat,

      Nor any cloud would cross the vault,

But day increased from heat to heat,

      On stony drought and steaming salt;

Till now at noon she slept again,

      And seem'd knee-deep in mountain grass,

      And heard her native breezes pass,

And runlets babbling down the glen.

          She breathed in sleep a lower moan,

              And murmuring, as at night and morn

          She thought, "My spirit is here alone,

              Walks forgotten, and is forlorn."


Dreaming, she knew it was a dream:

      She felt he was and was not there.

She woke: the babble of the stream

      Fell, and, without, the steady glare

Shrank one sick willow sere and small.

      The river-bed was dusty-white;

      And all the furnace of the light

Struck up against the blinding wall.

          She whisper'd, with a stifled moan

              More inward than at night or morn,

          "Sweet Mother, let me not here alone

                Live forgotten and die forlorn."


And, rising, from her bosom drew

      Old letters, breathing of her worth,

For "Love", they said, "must needs be true,

      To what is loveliest upon earth."

An image seem'd to pass the door,

      To look at her with slight, and say,

      "But now thy beauty flows away,

So be alone for evermore."

          "O cruel heart," she changed her tone,

              "And cruel love, whose end is scorn,

          Is this the end to be left alone,

              To live forgotten, and die forlorn?"


But sometimes in the falling day

      An image seem'd to pass the door,

To look into her eyes and say,

      "But thou shalt be alone no more."

And flaming downward over all

      From heat to heat the day decreased,

      And slowly rounded to the east

The one black shadow from the wall.

          "The day to night," she made her moan,

              "The day to night, the night to morn,

          And day and night I am left alone

              To live forgotten, and love forlorn."


At eve a dry cicala sung,

      There came a sound as of the sea;

Backward the lattice-blind she flung,

      And lean'd upon the balcony.

There all in spaces rosy-bright

      Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,

      And deepening thro' the silent spheres

Heaven over Heaven rose the night.

          And weeping then she made her moan,

              "The night comes on that knows not morn,

          When I shall cease to be all alone,

              To live forgotten, and love forlorn."

Poem 89: Merlin And Vivien

A storm was coming, but the winds were still,

And in the wild woods of Broceliande,

Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old

It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,

At Merlin's feet the wily Vivien lay.


For he that always bare in bitter grudge

The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark

The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,

A minstrel of Caerlon by strong storm

Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say

That out of naked knightlike purity

Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl

But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,

Sware by her--vows like theirs, that high in heaven

Love most, but neither marry, nor are given

In marriage, angels of our Lord's report.


He ceased, and then--for Vivien sweetly said

(She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),

'And is the fair example followed, Sir,

In Arthur's household?'--answered innocently:


'Ay, by some few--ay, truly--youths that hold

It more beseems the perfect virgin knight

To worship woman as true wife beyond

All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.

They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.

So passionate for an utter purity

Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,

For Arthur bound them not to singleness.

Brave hearts and clean! and yet--God guide them--young.'


Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup

Straight at the speaker, but forbore:  he rose

To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,

Turned to her:  'Here are snakes within the grass;

And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear

The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure

Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.'


And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,

'Why fear? because that fostered at THY court

I savour of thy--virtues? fear them? no.

As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,

So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.

My father died in battle against the King,

My mother on his corpse in open field;

She bore me there, for born from death was I

Among the dead and sown upon the wind--

And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,

That old true filth, and bottom of the well

Where Truth is hidden.  Gracious lessons thine

And maxims of the mud!  "This Arthur pure!

Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made

Gives him the lie!  There is no being pure,

My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?"--

If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.

Thy blessing, stainless King!  I bring thee back,

When I have ferreted out their burrowings,

The hearts of all this Order in mine hand--

Ay--so that fate and craft and folly close,

Perchance, one curl of Arthur's golden beard.

To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine

Is cleaner-fashioned--Well, I loved thee first,

That warps the wit.'


                    Loud laughed the graceless Mark,

But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged

Low in the city, and on a festal day

When Guinevere was crossing the great hall

Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.


'Why kneel ye there?  What evil hath ye wrought?

Rise!' and the damsel bidden rise arose

And stood with folded hands and downward eyes

Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,

'None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!

My father died in battle for thy King,

My mother on his corpse--in open field,

The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse--

Poor wretch--no friend!--and now by Mark the King

For that small charm of feature mine, pursued--

If any such be mine--I fly to thee.

Save, save me thou--Woman of women--thine

The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,

Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven's own white

Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King--

Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!

O yield me shelter for mine innocency

Among thy maidens!


                  Here her slow sweet eyes

Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose

Fixt on her hearer's, while the Queen who stood

All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves

In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,

'Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame

We choose the last.  Our noble Arthur, him

Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.

Nay--we believe all evil of thy Mark--

Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour

We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.

He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;

We go to prove it.  Bide ye here the while.'


She past; and Vivien murmured after 'Go!

I bide the while.'  Then through the portal-arch

Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,

As one that labours with an evil dream,

Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.


'Is that the Lancelot? goodly--ay, but gaunt:

Courteous--amends for gauntness--takes her hand--

That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been

A clinging kiss--how hand lingers in hand!

Let go at last!--they ride away--to hawk

For waterfowl.  Royaller game is mine.

For such a supersensual sensual bond

As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth--

Touch flax with flame--a glance will serve--the liars!

Ah little rat that borest in the dyke

Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep

Down upon far-off cities while they dance--

Or dream--of thee they dreamed not--nor of me

These--ay, but each of either:  ride, and dream

The mortal dream that never yet was mine--

Ride, ride and dream until ye wake--to me!

Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!

For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,

And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,

Will hate, loathe, fear--but honour me the more.'


Yet while they rode together down the plain,

Their talk was all of training, terms of art,

Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.

'She is too noble' he said 'to check at pies,

Nor will she rake:  there is no baseness in her.'

Here when the Queen demanded as by chance

'Know ye the stranger woman?'  'Let her be,'

Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off

The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,

Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up

Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,

Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird

Who pounced her quarry and slew it.  Many a time

As once--of old--among the flowers--they rode.


But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen

Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched

And whispered:  through the peaceful court she crept

And whispered:  then as Arthur in the highest

Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,

Arriving at a time of golden rest,

And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,

While all the heathen lay at Arthur's feet,

And no quest came, but all was joust and play,

Leavened his hall.  They heard and let her be.


Thereafter as an enemy that has left

Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,

The wily Vivien stole from Arthur's court.


She hated all the knights, and heard in thought

Their lavish comment when her name was named.

For once, when Arthur walking all alone,

Vext at a rumour issued from herself

Of some corruption crept among his knights,

Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,

Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood

With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,

And fluttered adoration, and at last

With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more

Than who should prize him most; at which the King

Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:

But one had watched, and had not held his peace:

It made the laughter of an afternoon

That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.

And after that, she set herself to gain

Him, the most famous man of all those times,

Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,

Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,

Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;

The people called him Wizard; whom at first

She played about with slight and sprightly talk,

And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points

Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;

And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer

Would watch her at her petulance, and play,

Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh

As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew

Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,

Perceiving that she was but half disdained,

Began to break her sports with graver fits,

Turn red or pale, would often when they met

Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him

With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,

Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times

Would flatter his own wish in age for love,

And half believe her true:  for thus at times

He wavered; but that other clung to him,

Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.


Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;

He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found

A doom that ever poised itself to fall,

An ever-moaning battle in the mist,

World-war of dying flesh against the life,

Death in all life and lying in all love,

The meanest having power upon the highest,

And the high purpose broken by the worm.


So leaving Arthur's court he gained the beach;

There found a little boat, and stept into it;

And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.

She took the helm and he the sail; the boat

Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,

And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.

And then she followed Merlin all the way,

Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.

For Merlin once had told her of a charm,

The which if any wrought on anyone

With woven paces and with waving arms,

The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie

Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,

From which was no escape for evermore;

And none could find that man for evermore,

Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm

Coming and going, and he lay as dead

And lost to life and use and name and fame.

And Vivien ever sought to work the charm

Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,

As fancying that her glory would be great

According to his greatness whom she quenched.


There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,

As if in deepest reverence and in love.

A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe

Of samite without price, that more exprest

Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,

In colour like the satin-shining palm

On sallows in the windy gleams of March:

And while she kissed them, crying, 'Trample me,

Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,

And I will pay you worship; tread me down

And I will kiss you for it;' he was mute:

So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,

As on a dull day in an Ocean cave

The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall

In silence:  wherefore, when she lifted up

A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,

'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and again,

'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and once more,

'Great Master, do ye love me?' he was mute.

And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,

Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,

Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet

Together, curved an arm about his neck,

Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand

Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,

Made with her right a comb of pearl to part

The lists of such a board as youth gone out

Had left in ashes:  then he spoke and said,

Not looking at her, 'Who are wise in love

Love most, say least,' and Vivien answered quick,

'I saw the little elf-god eyeless once

In Arthur's arras hall at Camelot:

But neither eyes nor tongue--O stupid child!

Yet you are wise who say it; let me think

Silence is wisdom:  I am silent then,

And ask no kiss;' then adding all at once,

'And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,' drew

The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard

Across her neck and bosom to her knee,

And called herself a gilded summer fly

Caught in a great old tyrant spider's web,

Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood

Without one word.  So Vivien called herself,

But rather seemed a lovely baleful star

Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:

'To what request for what strange boon,' he said,

'Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,

O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,

For these have broken up my melancholy.'


And Vivien answered smiling saucily,

'What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?

I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!

But yesterday you never opened lip,

Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:

In mine own lady palms I culled the spring

That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,

And made a pretty cup of both my hands

And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank

And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;

O no more thanks than might a goat have given

With no more sign of reverence than a beard.

And when we halted at that other well,

And I was faint to swooning, and you lay

Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those

Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know

That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?

And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood

And all this morning when I fondled you:

Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange--

How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,

But such a silence is more wise than kind.'


And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:

'O did ye never lie upon the shore,

And watch the curled white of the coming wave

Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?

Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,

Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,

Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.

And then I rose and fled from Arthur's court

To break the mood.  You followed me unasked;

And when I looked, and saw you following me still,

My mind involved yourself the nearest thing

In that mind-mist:  for shall I tell you truth?

You seemed that wave about to break upon me

And sweep me from my hold upon the world,

My use and name and fame.  Your pardon, child.

Your pretty sports have brightened all again.

And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,

Once for wrong done you by confusion, next

For thanks it seems till now neglected, last

For these your dainty gambols:  wherefore ask;

And take this boon so strange and not so strange.'


And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:

'O not so strange as my long asking it,

Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,

Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.

I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;

And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.

The people call you prophet:  let it be:

But not of those that can expound themselves.

Take Vivien for expounder; she will call

That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours

No presage, but the same mistrustful mood

That makes you seem less noble than yourself,

Whenever I have asked this very boon,

Now asked again:  for see you not, dear love,

That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed

Your fancy when ye saw me following you,

Must make me fear still more you are not mine,

Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,

And make me wish still more to learn this charm

Of woven paces and of waving hands,

As proof of trust.  O Merlin, teach it me.

The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.

For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,

I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,

Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.

And therefore be as great as ye are named,

Not muffled round with selfish reticence.

How hard you look and how denyingly!

O, if you think this wickedness in me,

That I should prove it on you unawares,

That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond

Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,

By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,

As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:

O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,

If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,

Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,

Have tript on such conjectural treachery--

May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell

Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,

If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,

Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;

And grant my re-reiterated wish,

The great proof of your love:  because I think,

However wise, ye hardly know me yet.'


And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,

'I never was less wise, however wise,

Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,

Than when I told you first of such a charm.

Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,

Too much I trusted when I told you that,

And stirred this vice in you which ruined man

Through woman the first hour; for howsoe'er

In children a great curiousness be well,

Who have to learn themselves and all the world,

In you, that are no child, for still I find

Your face is practised when I spell the lines,

I call it,--well, I will not call it vice:

But since you name yourself the summer fly,

I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,

That settles, beaten back, and beaten back

Settles, till one could yield for weariness:

But since I will not yield to give you power

Upon my life and use and name and fame,

Why will ye never ask some other boon?

Yea, by God's rood, I trusted you too much.'


And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid

That ever bided tryst at village stile,

Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:

'Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;

Caress her:  let her feel herself forgiven

Who feels no heart to ask another boon.

I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme

Of "trust me not at all or all in all."

I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,

And it shall answer for me.  Listen to it.


"In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,

Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:

Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.


"It is the little rift within the lute,

That by and by will make the music mute,

And ever widening slowly silence all.


"The little rift within the lover's lute

Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,

That rotting inward slowly moulders all.


"It is not worth the keeping:  let it go:

But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.

And trust me not at all or all in all."


O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?'


And Merlin looked and half believed her true,

So tender was her voice, so fair her face,

So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears

Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:

And yet he answered half indignantly:


'Far other was the song that once I heard

By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:

For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,

To chase a creature that was current then

In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.

It was the time when first the question rose

About the founding of a Table Round,

That was to be, for love of God and men

And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.

And each incited each to noble deeds.

And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,

We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,

And into such a song, such fire for fame,

Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down

To such a stern and iron-clashing close,

That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,

And should have done it; but the beauteous beast

Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,

And like a silver shadow slipt away

Through the dim land; and all day long we rode

Through the dim land against a rushing wind,

That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,

And chased the flashes of his golden horns

Till they vanished by the fairy well

That laughs at iron--as our warriors did--

Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,

"Laugh, little well!" but touch it with a sword,

It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there

We lost him:  such a noble song was that.

But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,

I felt as though you knew this cursd charm,

Were proving it on me, and that I lay

And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.'


And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:

'O mine have ebbed away for evermore,

And all through following you to this wild wood,

Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.

Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount

As high as woman in her selfless mood.

And touching fame, howe'er ye scorn my song,

Take one verse more--the lady speaks it--this:


'"My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,

For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,

And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.

So trust me not at all or all in all."


'Says she not well? and there is more--this rhyme

Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,

That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;

Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.

But nevermore the same two sister pearls

Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other

On her white neck--so is it with this rhyme:

It lives dispersedly in many hands,

And every minstrel sings it differently;

Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:

"Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love."

Yea!  Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves

A portion from the solid present, eats

And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,

The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;

And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,

And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself

Know well that Envy calls you Devil's son,

And since ye seem the Master of all Art,

They fain would make you Master of all vice.'


And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,

'I once was looking for a magic weed,

And found a fair young squire who sat alone,

Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,

And then was painting on it fancied arms,

Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun

In dexter chief; the scroll "I follow fame."

And speaking not, but leaning over him

I took his brush and blotted out the bird,

And made a Gardener putting in a graff,

With this for motto, "Rather use than fame."

You should have seen him blush; but afterwards

He made a stalwart knight.  O Vivien,

For you, methinks you think you love me well;

For me, I love you somewhat; rest:  and Love

Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,

Not ever be too curious for a boon,

Too prurient for a proof against the grain

Of him ye say ye love:  but Fame with men,

Being but ampler means to serve mankind,

Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,

But work as vassal to the larger love,

That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.

Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again

Increasing gave me use.  Lo, there my boon!

What other? for men sought to prove me vile,

Because I fain had given them greater wits:

And then did Envy call me Devil's son:

The sick weak beast seeking to help herself

By striking at her better, missed, and brought

Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.

Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,

But when my name was lifted up, the storm

Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.

Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,

Yet needs must work my work.  That other fame,

To one at least, who hath not children, vague,

The cackle of the unborn about the grave,

I cared not for it:  a single misty star,

Which is the second in a line of stars

That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,

I never gazed upon it but I dreamt

Of some vast charm concluded in that star

To make fame nothing.  Wherefore, if I fear,

Giving you power upon me through this charm,

That you might play me falsely, having power,

However well ye think ye love me now

(As sons of kings loving in pupilage

Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)

I rather dread the loss of use than fame;

If you--and not so much from wickedness,

As some wild turn of anger, or a mood

Of overstrained affection, it may be,

To keep me all to your own self,--or else

A sudden spurt of woman's jealousy,--

Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.'


And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:

'Have I not sworn?  I am not trusted.  Good!

Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;

And being found take heed of Vivien.

A woman and not trusted, doubtless I

Might feel some sudden turn of anger born

Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet

Is accurate too, for this full love of mine

Without the full heart back may merit well

Your term of overstrained.  So used as I,

My daily wonder is, I love at all.

And as to woman's jealousy, O why not?

O to what end, except a jealous one,

And one to make me jealous if I love,

Was this fair charm invented by yourself?

I well believe that all about this world

Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,

Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower

From which is no escape for evermore.'


Then the great Master merrily answered her:

'Full many a love in loving youth was mine;

I needed then no charm to keep them mine

But youth and love; and that full heart of yours

Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;

So live uncharmed.  For those who wrought it first,

The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,

The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones

Who paced it, ages back:  but will ye hear

The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?


'There lived a king in the most Eastern East,

Less old than I, yet older, for my blood

Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.

A tawny pirate anchored in his port,

Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;

And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,

He saw two cities in a thousand boats

All fighting for a woman on the sea.

And pushing his black craft among them all,

He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,

With loss of half his people arrow-slain;

A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,

They said a light came from her when she moved:

And since the pirate would not yield her up,

The King impaled him for his piracy;

Then made her Queen:  but those isle-nurtured eyes

Waged such unwilling though successful war

On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,

And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew

The rustiest iron of old fighters' hearts;

And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt

Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back

That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees

Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,

To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.

What wonder, being jealous, that he sent

His horns of proclamation out through all

The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed

To find a wizard who might teach the King

Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen

Might keep her all his own:  to such a one

He promised more than ever king has given,

A league of mountain full of golden mines,

A province with a hundred miles of coast,

A palace and a princess, all for him:

But on all those who tried and failed, the King

Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it

To keep the list low and pretenders back,

Or like a king, not to be trifled with--

Their heads should moulder on the city gates.

And many tried and failed, because the charm

Of nature in her overbore their own:

And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:

And many weeks a troop of carrion crows

Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.'


And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:

'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,

Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.

The lady never made UNWILLING war

With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,

And made her good man jealous with good cause.

And lived there neither dame nor damsel then

Wroth at a lover's loss? were all as tame,

I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?

Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,

Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,

Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?

Well, those were not our days:  but did they find

A wizard?  Tell me, was he like to thee?


She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck

Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes

Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride's

On her new lord, her own, the first of men.


He answered laughing, 'Nay, not like to me.

At last they found--his foragers for charms--

A little glassy-headed hairless man,

Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;

Read but one book, and ever reading grew

So grated down and filed away with thought,

So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin

Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.

And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,

Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,

Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall

That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men

Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,

And heard their voices talk behind the wall,

And learnt their elemental secrets, powers

And forces; often o'er the sun's bright eye

Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,

And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;

Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,

When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,

And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned

The world to peace again:  here was the man.

And so by force they dragged him to the King.

And then he taught the King to charm the Queen

In such-wise, that no man could see her more,

Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,

Coming and going, and she lay as dead,

And lost all use of life:  but when the King

Made proffer of the league of golden mines,

The province with a hundred miles of coast,

The palace and the princess, that old man

Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,

And vanished, and his book came down to me.'


And Vivien answered smiling saucily:

'Ye have the book:  the charm is written in it:

Good:  take my counsel:  let me know it at once:

For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,

With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,

And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound

As after furious battle turfs the slain

On some wild down above the windy deep,

I yet should strike upon a sudden means

To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:

Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?'


And smiling as a master smiles at one

That is not of his school, nor any school

But that where blind and naked Ignorance

Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,

On all things all day long, he answered her:


'Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!

O ay, it is but twenty pages long,

But every page having an ample marge,

And every marge enclosing in the midst

A square of text that looks a little blot,

The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;

And every square of text an awful charm,

Writ in a language that has long gone by.

So long, that mountains have arisen since

With cities on their flanks--thou read the book!

And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed

With comment, densest condensation, hard

To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights

Of my long life have made it easy to me.

And none can read the text, not even I;

And none can read the comment but myself;

And in the comment did I find the charm.

O, the results are simple; a mere child

Might use it to the harm of anyone,

And never could undo it:  ask no more:

For though you should not prove it upon me,

But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,

Assay it on some one of the Table Round,

And all because ye dream they babble of you.'


And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:

'What dare the full-fed liars say of me?

THEY ride abroad redressing human wrongs!

They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!

THEY bound to holy vows of chastity!

Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.

But you are man, you well can understand

The shame that cannot be explained for shame.

Not one of all the drove should touch me:  swine!'


Then answered Merlin careless of her words:

'You breathe but accusation vast and vague,

Spleen-born, I think, and proofless.  If ye know,

Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!'


And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:

'O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him

Whose kinsman left him watcher o'er his wife

And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;

Was one year gone, and on returning found

Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one

But one hour old!  What said the happy sire?'

A seven-months' babe had been a truer gift.

Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.'


Then answered Merlin, 'Nay, I know the tale.

Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:

Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:

One child they had:  it lived with her:  she died:

His kinsman travelling on his own affair

Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.

He brought, not found it therefore:  take the truth.'


'O ay,' said Vivien, 'overtrue a tale.

What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,

That ardent man? "to pluck the flower in season,"

So says the song, "I trow it is no treason."

O Master, shall we call him overquick

To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?'


And Merlin answered, 'Overquick art thou

To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing

Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey

Is man's good name:  he never wronged his bride.

I know the tale.  An angry gust of wind

Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed

And many-corridored complexities

Of Arthur's palace:  then he found a door,

And darkling felt the sculptured ornament

That wreathen round it made it seem his own;

And wearied out made for the couch and slept,

A stainless man beside a stainless maid;

And either slept, nor knew of other there;

Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose

In Arthur's casement glimmered chastely down,

Blushing upon them blushing, and at once

He rose without a word and parted from her:

But when the thing was blazed about the court,

The brute world howling forced them into bonds,

And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.'


'O ay,' said Vivien, 'that were likely too.

What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale

And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,

The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,

Or some black wether of St Satan's fold.

What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,

Among the knightly brasses of the graves,

And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!'


And Merlin answered careless of her charge,

'A sober man is Percivale and pure;

But once in life was flustered with new wine,

Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;

Where one of Satan's shepherdesses caught

And meant to stamp him with her master's mark;

And that he sinned is not believable;

For, look upon his face!--but if he sinned,

The sin that practice burns into the blood,

And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,

Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:

Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns

Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.

But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?'


And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:

'O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend

Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,

I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,

Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?'


To which he answered sadly, 'Yea, I know it.

Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,

To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.

A rumour runs, she took him for the King,

So fixt her fancy on him:  let them be.

But have ye no one word of loyal praise

For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?'


She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:

'Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?

Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?

By which the good King means to blind himself,

And blinds himself and all the Table Round

To all the foulness that they work.  Myself

Could call him (were it not for womanhood)

The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,

Could call him the main cause of all their crime;

Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.'


Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:

'O true and tender!  O my liege and King!

O selfless man and stainless gentleman,

Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain

Have all men true and leal, all women pure;

How, in the mouths of base interpreters,

From over-fineness not intelligible

To things with every sense as false and foul

As the poached filth that floods the middle street,

Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!'


But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne

By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue

Rage like a fire among the noblest names,

Polluting, and imputing her whole self,

Defaming and defacing, till she left

Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.


Her words had issue other than she willed.

He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made

A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,

And muttered in himself, 'Tell HER the charm!

So, if she had it, would she rail on me

To snare the next, and if she have it not

So will she rail.  What did the wanton say?

"Not mount as high;" we scarce can sink as low:

For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,

But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.

I know the Table Round, my friends of old;

All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.

She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;

I well believe she tempted them and failed,

Being so bitter:  for fine plots may fail,

Though harlots paint their talk as well as face

With colours of the heart that are not theirs.

I will not let her know:  nine tithes of times

Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.

And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime

Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,

Wanting the mental range; or low desire

Not to feel lowest makes them level all;

Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,

To leave an equal baseness; and in this

Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find

Some stain or blemish in a name of note,

Not grieving that their greatest are so small,

Inflate themselves with some insane delight,

And judge all nature from her feet of clay,

Without the will to lift their eyes, and see

Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,

And touching other worlds.  I am weary of her.'


He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,

Half-suffocated in the hoary fell

And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.

But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,

And hearing 'harlot' muttered twice or thrice,

Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood

Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,

How from the rosy lips of life and love,

Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!

White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed

Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched

Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,

And feeling; had she found a dagger there

(For in a wink the false love turns to hate)

She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:

His eye was calm, and suddenly she took

To bitter weeping like a beaten child,

A long, long weeping, not consolable.

Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:


'O crueller than was ever told in tale,

Or sung in song!  O vainly lavished love!

O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,

Or seeming shameful--for what shame in love,

So love be true, and not as yours is--nothing

Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust

Who called her what he called her--all her crime,

All--all--the wish to prove him wholly hers.'


She mused a little, and then clapt her hands

Together with a wailing shriek, and said:

'Stabbed through the heart's affections to the heart!

Seethed like the kid in its own mother's milk!

Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!

I thought that he was gentle, being great:

O God, that I had loved a smaller man!

I should have found in him a greater heart.

O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw

The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,

Who loved to make men darker than they are,

Because of that high pleasure which I had

To seat you sole upon my pedestal

Of worship--I am answered, and henceforth

The course of life that seemed so flowery to me

With you for guide and master, only you,

Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,

And ending in a ruin--nothing left,

But into some low cave to crawl, and there,

If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,

Killed with inutterable unkindliness.'


She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,

The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid

Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,

And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm

In silence, while his anger slowly died

Within him, till he let his wisdom go

For ease of heart, and half believed her true:

Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,

'Come from the storm,' and having no reply,

Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face

Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;

Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,

To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.

At last she let herself be conquered by him,

And as the cageling newly flown returns,

The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing

Came to her old perch back, and settled there.

There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,

Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw

The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,

About her, more in kindness than in love,

The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.

But she dislinked herself at once and rose,

Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,

A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,

Upright and flushed before him:  then she said:


'There must now be no passages of love

Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;

Since, if I be what I am grossly called,

What should be granted which your own gross heart

Would reckon worth the taking?  I will go.

In truth, but one thing now--better have died

Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay--

That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!

How justly, after that vile term of yours,

I find with grief!  I might believe you then,

Who knows? once more.  Lo! what was once to me

Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown

The vast necessity of heart and life.

Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear

My fate or folly, passing gayer youth

For one so old, must be to love thee still.

But ere I leave thee let me swear once more

That if I schemed against thy peace in this,

May yon just heaven, that darkens o'er me, send

One flash, that, missing all things else, may make

My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.'


Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt

(For now the storm was close above them) struck,

Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining

With darted spikes and splinters of the wood

The dark earth round.  He raised his eyes and saw

The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.

But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,

And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,

And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps

That followed, flying back and crying out,

'O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,

Yet save me!' clung to him and hugged him close;

And called him dear protector in her fright,

Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,

But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.

The pale blood of the wizard at her touch

Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.

She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:

She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept

Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,

Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,

Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love

Of her whole life; and ever overhead

Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch

Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain

Above them; and in change of glare and gloom

Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;

Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,

Moaning and calling out of other lands,

Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more

To peace; and what should not have been had been,

For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,

Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.


Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm

Of woven paces and of waving hands,

And in the hollow oak he lay as dead,

And lost to life and use and name and fame.


Then crying 'I have made his glory mine,'

And shrieking out 'O fool!' the harlot leapt

Adown the forest, and the thicket closed

Behind her, and the forest echoed 'fool.'

Poem 90: Milton (Alcaics)

O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,

O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity,

      God-gifted organ-voice of England,

          Milton, a name to resound for ages;

Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,

Starr'd from Jehovah's gorgeous armouries,

      Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean

          Rings to the roar of an angel onset--

Me rather all that bowery loneliness,

The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,

      And bloom profuse and cedar arches

          Charm, as a wanderer out in ocean,

Where some refulgent sunset of India

  Streams o'er a rich ambrosial ocean isle,

      And crimson-hued the stately palm-woods

          Whisper in odorous heights of even.

Poem 91: Minnie and Winnie

Minnie and Winnie

    Slept in a shell.

Sleep, little ladies!

    And they slept well.


Pink was the shell within,

    Silver without;

Sounds of the great sea

    Wander'd about.


Sleep, little ladies!

    Wake not soon!

Echo on echo

    Dies to the moon.


Two bright stars

    Peep'd into the shell.

"What are you dreaming of?

    Who can tell?"


Started a green linnet

    Out of the croft;

Wake, little ladies,

    The sun is aloft!

Poem 92: Morte D'Arthur

So all day long the noise of battle roll'd

  Among the mountains by the winter sea;

  Until King Arthur's table, man by man,

  Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord,

  King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,

  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,

  Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,

  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,

  A broken chancel with a broken cross,

  That stood on a dark strait of barren land.

  On one side lay the ocean, and on one

  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.


     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

  "The sequel of to-day unsolders all

  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights

  Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep

  They sleep--the men I loved. I think that we

  Shall never more, at any future time,

  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,

  Walking about the gardens and the halls

  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.

  I perish by this people which I made,--

  Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again

  To rule once more--but let what will be, be,

  I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm

  That without help I cannot last till morn.

  Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,

  Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how

  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm

  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,

  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

  Holding the sword--and how I row'd across

  And took it, and have worn it, like a king:

  And, wheresoever I am sung or told

  In aftertime, this also shall be known:

  But now delay not: take Excalibur,

  And fling him far into the middle mere:

  Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."


     To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:

  "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,

  Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.

  A little thing may harm a wounded man.

  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,

  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."


     So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept

  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,

  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,

  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang

  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down

  By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,

  Came on the shining levels of the lake.


     There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,

  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,

  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth

  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:

  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,

  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work

  Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long

  That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,

  This way and that dividing the swift mind,

  In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd

  Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd

  There in the many-knotted water-flags,

  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.

  So strode he back slow to the wounded King.


     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

  "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?

  What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

  "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,

  And the wild water lapping on the crag."


     To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:

  "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,

  Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd

  Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:

  For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,

  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.

  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.

  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again

  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing

  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."


     Then went Sir Bedivere the second time

  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,

  Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;

  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,

  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote

  His palms together, and he cried aloud,


     "And if indeed I cast the brand away,

  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,

  Should thus be lost forever from the earth,

  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.

  What good should follow this, if this were done?

  What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,

  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.

  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand

  An act unprofitable, against himself?

  The King is sick, and knows not what he does.

  What record, or what relic of my lord

  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath

  And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,

  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,

  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,

  Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,

  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake;

  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps

  Upon the hidden bases of the hills.'

  So might some old man speak in the aftertime

  To all the people, winning reverence.

  But now much honour and much fame were lost."


     So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,

  And hid Excalibur the second time,

  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.


     Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:

  "What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

  "I heard the water lapping on the crag,

  And the long ripple washing in the reeds."


      To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:

  "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,

  Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!

  Authority forgets a dying king,

  Laid widow'd of the power in his eye

  That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,

  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,

  In whom should meet the offices of all,

  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;

  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl

  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.

  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,

  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:

  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,

  I will arise and slay thee with my hands."


     Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,

  And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged

  Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,

  And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand

  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,

  And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,

  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,

  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock

  By night, with noises of the northern sea.

  So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:

  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm

  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

  And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him

  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.

  And lightly went the other to the King.


     Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:

  "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.

  Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

  "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems

  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,

  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,

  Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,

  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.

  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;

  But when I look'd again, behold an arm,

  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

  That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him

  Three times, and drew him under in the mere."


     And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:

  "My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone.

  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,

  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear

  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."


     So saying, from the pavement he half rose,

  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,

  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes

  As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere

  Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,

  And would have spoken, but he found not words,

  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,

  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,

  And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.


     But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,

  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed

  When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King

  Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick!

  I fear it is too late, and I shall die."

  But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,

  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd

  Larger than human on the frozen hills.

  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry

  Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.

  Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves

  And barren chasms, and all to left and right

  The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based

  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang

  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--

  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,

  And the long glories of the winter moon.


     Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge

  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,

  Beneath them; and descending they were ware

  That all the decks were dense with stately forms

  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these

  Three Queens with crowns of gold--and from them rose

  A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,

  And, as it were one voice, an agony

  Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills

  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,

  Or hath come, since the making of the world.


     Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge,"

  And to the barge they came. There those three Queens

  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.

  But she that rose the tallest of them all

  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,

  And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,

  And call'd him by his name, complaining loud

  And dropping bitter tears against his brow

  Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white

  And colourless, and like the wither'd moon

  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;

  And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops

  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--

  That made his forehead like a rising sun

  High from the daïs-throne--were parch'd with dust;

  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,

  Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.

  So like a shatter'd column lay the King;

  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,

  From spur to plume a star of tournament,

  Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged

  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.


     Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:

  "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?

  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?

  For now I see the true old times are dead,

  When every morning brought a noble chance,

  And every chance brought out a noble knight.

  Such times have been not since the light that led

  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.

  But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved

  Which was an image of the mighty world;

  And I, the last, go forth companionless,

  And the days darken round me, and the years,

  Among new men, strange faces, other minds."


     And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:

  "The old order changeth, yielding place to new,

  And God fulfils Himself in many ways,

  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.

  Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?

  I have lived my life, and that which I have done

  May He within Himself make pure! but thou,

  If thou shouldst never see my face again,

  Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer

  Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice

  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

  For what are men better than sheep or goats

  That nourish a blind life within the brain,

  If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer

  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?

  For so the whole round earth is every way

  Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

  But now farewell. I am going a long way

  With these thou seëst--if indeed I go--

  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)

  To the island-valley of Avilion;

  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,

  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies

  Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns

  And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,

  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."


     So said he, and the barge with oar and sail

  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan

  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,

  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood

  With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere

  Revolving many memories, till the hull

  Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,

  And on the mere the wailing died away.

Poem 93: Move Eastward, Happy Earth

Move eastward, happy earth, and leave

Yon orange sunset waning slow:

From fringes of the faded eve,

O, happy planet, eastward go:

Till over thy dark shoulder glow

Thy silver sister world, and rise

To glass herself in dewey eyes

That watch me from the glen below.


Ah, bear me with thee, lightly borne,

Dip forward under starry light,

And move me to my marriage-morn,

And round again to happy night.

Poem 96: Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal

Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;

Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;

Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font;

The firefly wakens, waken thou with me.


Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,

And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.


Now lies the Earth all Danae to the stars,

And all thy heart lies open unto me.


Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves

A shining furrow, as thy thoughts, in me.


Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,

And slips into the bosom of the lake.

So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip

Into my bosom and be lost in me.

Poem 97: O Beauty, Passing Beauty!

O beauty, passing beauty! Sweetest sweet!

How can thou let me waste my youth in sighs?

I only ask to sit beside thy feet.

Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes.

Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold

My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.

And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,

As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.

Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control

Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat

The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,

The bare word "kiss" hath made my inner soul

To tremble like a lute string, ere the note

Hath melted in the silence that it broke.

Poem 98: O, Were I Loved As I Desire To Be!

O, were I loved as I desire to be!

What is there in the great sphere of the earth,

Or range of evil between death and birth,

That I should fear, - if I were loved by thee!

All the inner, all the outer world of pain,

Clear love would pierce and cleave, if thou wert mine;

As I have heard that somewhere in the main

Fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.

'I were joy, not fear, clasped hand in hand with thee,

To wait for death - mute - careless of all ills,

Apart upon a mountain, though the surge

Of some new deluge from a thousand hills

Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge

Below us, as far on as eye could see.

Poem 99: Ode to Memory

I.

                   THOU who stealest fire,

           From the fountains of the past,

           To glorify the present, oh, haste,

                   Visit my low desire!

           Strengthen me, enlighten me!

           I faint in this obscurity,

           Thou dewy dawn of memory.


II.

       Come not as thou camest of late,

    Flinging the gloom of yesternight

On the white day, but robed in soften’d light

               Of orient state.

Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,

    Even as a maid, whose stately brow

The dew-impearled winds of dawn have kiss’d,

               When she, as thou,

Stays on her floating locks the lovely freight

Of overflowing blooms, and earliest shoots

Of orient green, giving safe pledge of fruits,

Which in wintertide shall star

The black earth with brilliance rare.


III.

Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,

       And with the evening cloud,

Showering thy gleaned wealth into my open breast;

Those peerless flowers which in the rudest wind

               Never grow sere,

When rooted in the garden of the mind,

    Because they are the earliest of the year.

           Nor was the night thy shroud.

In sweet dreams softer than unbroken rest

Thou leddest by the hand thine infant Hope.

The eddying of her garments caught from thee

The light of thy great presence; and the cope

    Of the half-attain’d futurity,

    Tho’ deep not fathomless,

Was cloven with the million stars which tremble

O’er the deep mind of dauntless infancy.

Small thought was there of life’s distress;

For sure she deem’d no mist of earth could dull

Those spirit-thrilling eyes so keen and beautiful;

Sure she was nigher to heaven’s spheres,

Listening the lordly music flowing from

               The illimitable years.

    O strengthen me, enlighten me!

    I faint in this obscurity,

    Thou dewy dawn of memory.


IV.

Come forth, I charge thee, arise,

Thou of the many tongues, the myriad eyes!

Thou comest not with shows of flaunting vines

           Unto mine inner eye,

           Divinest Memory!

    Thou wert not nursed by the waterfall

Which ever sounds and shines

    A pillar of white light upon the wall

Of purple cliffs, aloof descried:

Come from the woods that belt the gray hillside,

The seven elms, the poplars four

That stand beside my father’s door,

And chiefly from the brook that loves

To purl o’er matted cress and ribbed sand,

Or dimple in the dark of rushy coves,

Drawing into his narrow earthen urn,

           In every elbow and turn,

The filter’d tribute of the rough woodland;

           O! hither lead thy feet!

Pour round mine ears the livelong bleat

Of the thick-fleeced sheep from wattled folds,

           Upon the ridged wolds,

When the first matin-song hath waken’d loud

Over the dark dewy earth forlorn,

What time the amber morn

Forth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud.


V.

Large dowries doth the raptured eye

   To the young spirit present

       When first she is wed,

           And like a bride of old,

       In triumph led,

           With music and sweet showers

           Of festal flowers,

   Unto the dwelling she must sway.

Well hast thou done, great artist Memory.

    In setting round thy first experiment

       With royal framework of wrought gold;

Needs must thou dearly love thy first essay,

And foremost in thy various gallery

   Place it, where sweetest sunlight falls

   Upon the storied walls;

               For the discovery

And newness of thine art so pleased thee,

That all which thou hast drawn of fairest

Or boldest since but lightly weighs

With thee unto the love thou bearest

The first-born of thy genius. Artist-like,

Ever retiring thou dost gaze

On the prime labor of thine early days,

No matter what the sketch might be:

Whether the high field on the bushless pike,

Or even a sand-built ridge

Of heaped hills that mound the sea,

Overblown with murmurs harsh,

Or even a lowly cottage whence we see

Stretch’d wide and wild the waste enormous marsh,

Where from the frequent bridge,

Like emblems of infinity,

The trenched waters run from sky to sky;

Or a garden bower’d close

With plaited alleys of the trailing rose,

Long alleys falling down to twilight grots,

Or opening upon level plots

Of crowned lilies, standing near

Purple-spiked lavender:

Whither in after life retired

From brawling storms,

From weary wind,

With youthful fancy re-inspired,

       We may hold converse with all forms

Of the many-sided mind,

And those whom passion hath not blinded,

Subtle-thoughted, myriad-minded.

My friend, with you to live alone

Were how much better than to own

A crown, a sceptre, and a throne!


O strengthen me, englighten me!

I faint in this obscurity,

Thou dewy dawn of memory.

Poem 100: Of Old Sat Freedom

Of old sat Freedom on the heights,

    The thunders breaking at her feet:

Above her shook the starry lights:

    She heard the torrents meet.


There in her place she did rejoice,

    Self-gather'd in her prophet-mind,

But fragments of her mighty voice

    Came rolling on the wind.


Then stept she down thro' town and field

    To mingle with the human race,

And part by part to men reveal'd

    The fullness of her face --


Grave mother of majestic works,

    From her isle-alter gazing down,

Who, God-like, grasps the triple forks,

    And, King-like, wears the crown:


Her open eyes desire the truth.

    The wisdom of a thousand years

Is in them. May perpetual youth

    Keep dry their light from tears;


That her fair form may stand and shine

    Make bright our days and light our dreams,

Turning to scorn with lips divine

    The falsehood of extremes!

Poem 101: Pelleas And Ettarre

King Arthur made new knights to fill the gap

Left by the Holy Quest; and as he sat

In hall at old Caerleon, the high doors

Were softly sundered, and through these a youth,

Pelleas, and the sweet smell of the fields

Past, and the sunshine came along with him.


`Make me thy knight, because I know, Sir King,

All that belongs to knighthood, and I love.'

Such was his cry:  for having heard the King

Had let proclaim a tournament--the prize

A golden circlet and a knightly sword,

Full fain had Pelleas for his lady won

The golden circlet, for himself the sword:

And there were those who knew him near the King,

And promised for him:  and Arthur made him knight.


And this new knight, Sir Pelleas of the isles--

But lately come to his inheritance,

And lord of many a barren isle was he--

Riding at noon, a day or twain before,

Across the forest called of Dean, to find

Caerleon and the King, had felt the sun

Beat like a strong knight on his helm, and reeled

Almost to falling from his horse; but saw

Near him a mound of even-sloping side,

Whereon a hundred stately beeches grew,

And here and there great hollies under them;

But for a mile all round was open space,

And fern and heath:  and slowly Pelleas drew

To that dim day, then binding his good horse

To a tree, cast himself down; and as he lay

At random looking over the brown earth

Through that green-glooming twilight of the grove,

It seemed to Pelleas that the fern without

Burnt as a living fire of emeralds,

So that his eyes were dazzled looking at it.

Then o'er it crost the dimness of a cloud

Floating, and once the shadow of a bird

Flying, and then a fawn; and his eyes closed.

And since he loved all maidens, but no maid

In special, half-awake he whispered, `Where?

O where? I love thee, though I know thee not.

For fair thou art and pure as Guinevere,

And I will make thee with my spear and sword

As famous--O my Queen, my Guinevere,

For I will be thine Arthur when we meet.'


Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk

And laughter at the limit of the wood,

And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw,

Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed

A vision hovering on a sea of fire,

Damsels in divers colours like the cloud

Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them

On horses, and the horses richly trapt

Breast-high in that bright line of bracken stood:

And all the damsels talked confusedly,

And one was pointing this way, and one that,

Because the way was lost.


                        And Pelleas rose,

And loosed his horse, and led him to the light.

There she that seemed the chief among them said,

`In happy time behold our pilot-star!

Youth, we are damsels-errant, and we ride,

Armed as ye see, to tilt against the knights

There at Caerleon, but have lost our way:

To right? to left? straight forward? back again?

Which? tell us quickly.'


                       Pelleas gazing thought,

`Is Guinevere herself so beautiful?'

For large her violet eyes looked, and her bloom

A rosy dawn kindled in stainless heavens,

And round her limbs, mature in womanhood;

And slender was her hand and small her shape;

And but for those large eyes, the haunts of scorn,

She might have seemed a toy to trifle with,

And pass and care no more.  But while he gazed

The beauty of her flesh abashed the boy,

As though it were the beauty of her soul:

For as the base man, judging of the good,

Puts his own baseness in him by default

Of will and nature, so did Pelleas lend

All the young beauty of his own soul to hers,

Believing her; and when she spake to him,

Stammered, and could not make her a reply.

For out of the waste islands had he come,

Where saving his own sisters he had known

Scarce any but the women of his isles,

Rough wives, that laughed and screamed against the gulls,

Makers of nets, and living from the sea.


Then with a slow smile turned the lady round

And looked upon her people; and as when

A stone is flung into some sleeping tarn,

The circle widens till it lip the marge,

Spread the slow smile through all her company.

Three knights were thereamong; and they too smiled,

Scorning him; for the lady was Ettarre,

And she was a great lady in her land.


Again she said, `O wild and of the woods,

Knowest thou not the fashion of our speech?

Or have the Heavens but given thee a fair face,

Lacking a tongue?'


                 `O damsel,' answered he,

`I woke from dreams; and coming out of gloom

Was dazzled by the sudden light, and crave

Pardon:  but will ye to Caerleon?  I

Go likewise:  shall I lead you to the King?'


`Lead then,' she said; and through the woods they went.

And while they rode, the meaning in his eyes,

His tenderness of manner, and chaste awe,

His broken utterances and bashfulness,

Were all a burthen to her, and in her heart

She muttered, `I have lighted on a fool,

Raw, yet so stale!'  But since her mind was bent

On hearing, after trumpet blown, her name

And title, `Queen of Beauty,' in the lists

Cried--and beholding him so strong, she thought

That peradventure he will fight for me,

And win the circlet:  therefore flattered him,

Being so gracious, that he wellnigh deemed

His wish by hers was echoed; and her knights

And all her damsels too were gracious to him,

For she was a great lady.


                        And when they reached

Caerleon, ere they past to lodging, she,

Taking his hand, `O the strong hand,' she said,

`See! look at mine! but wilt thou fight for me,

And win me this fine circlet, Pelleas,

That I may love thee?'


                     Then his helpless heart

Leapt, and he cried, `Ay! wilt thou if I win?'

`Ay, that will I,' she answered, and she laughed,

And straitly nipt the hand, and flung it from her;

Then glanced askew at those three knights of hers,

Till all her ladies laughed along with her.


`O happy world,' thought Pelleas, `all, meseems,

Are happy; I the happiest of them all.'

Nor slept that night for pleasure in his blood,

And green wood-ways, and eyes among the leaves;

Then being on the morrow knighted, sware

To love one only.  And as he came away,

The men who met him rounded on their heels

And wondered after him, because his face

Shone like the countenance of a priest of old

Against the flame about a sacrifice

Kindled by fire from heaven:  so glad was he.


Then Arthur made vast banquets, and strange knights

From the four winds came in:  and each one sat,

Though served with choice from air, land, stream, and sea,

Oft in mid-banquet measuring with his eyes

His neighbour's make and might:  and Pelleas looked

Noble among the noble, for he dreamed

His lady loved him, and he knew himself

Loved of the King:  and him his new-made knight

Worshipt, whose lightest whisper moved him more

Than all the rangd reasons of the world.


Then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts,

And this was called `The Tournament of Youth:'

For Arthur, loving his young knight, withheld

His older and his mightier from the lists,

That Pelleas might obtain his lady's love,

According to her promise, and remain

Lord of the tourney.  And Arthur had the jousts

Down in the flat field by the shore of Usk

Holden:  the gilded parapets were crowned

With faces, and the great tower filled with eyes

Up to the summit, and the trumpets blew.

There all day long Sir Pelleas kept the field

With honour:  so by that strong hand of his

The sword and golden circlet were achieved.


Then rang the shout his lady loved:  the heat

Of pride and glory fired her face; her eye

Sparkled; she caught the circlet from his lance,

And there before the people crowned herself:

So for the last time she was gracious to him.


Then at Caerleon for a space--her look

Bright for all others, cloudier on her knight--

Lingered Ettarre:  and seeing Pelleas droop,

Said Guinevere, `We marvel at thee much,

O damsel, wearing this unsunny face

To him who won thee glory!'  And she said,

`Had ye not held your Lancelot in your bower,

My Queen, he had not won.'  Whereat the Queen,

As one whose foot is bitten by an ant,

Glanced down upon her, turned and went her way.


But after, when her damsels, and herself,

And those three knights all set their faces home,

Sir Pelleas followed.  She that saw him cried,

`Damsels--and yet I should be shamed to say it--

I cannot bide Sir Baby.  Keep him back

Among yourselves.  Would rather that we had

Some rough old knight who knew the worldly way,

Albeit grizzlier than a bear, to ride

And jest with:  take him to you, keep him off,

And pamper him with papmeat, if ye will,

Old milky fables of the wolf and sheep,

Such as the wholesome mothers tell their boys.

Nay, should ye try him with a merry one

To find his mettle, good:  and if he fly us,

Small matter! let him.'  This her damsels heard,

And mindful of her small and cruel hand,

They, closing round him through the journey home,

Acted her hest, and always from her side

Restrained him with all manner of device,

So that he could not come to speech with her.

And when she gained her castle, upsprang the bridge,

Down rang the grate of iron through the groove,

And he was left alone in open field.


`These be the ways of ladies,' Pelleas thought,

`To those who love them, trials of our faith.

Yea, let her prove me to the uttermost,

For loyal to the uttermost am I.'

So made his moan; and darkness falling, sought

A priory not far off, there lodged, but rose

With morning every day, and, moist or dry,

Full-armed upon his charger all day long

Sat by the walls, and no one opened to him.


And this persistence turned her scorn to wrath.

Then calling her three knights, she charged them, `Out!

And drive him from the walls.'  And out they came

But Pelleas overthrew them as they dashed

Against him one by one; and these returned,

But still he kept his watch beneath the wall.


Thereon her wrath became a hate; and once,

A week beyond, while walking on the walls

With her three knights, she pointed downward, `Look,

He haunts me--I cannot breathe--besieges me;

Down! strike him! put my hate into your strokes,

And drive him from my walls.'  And down they went,

And Pelleas overthrew them one by one;

And from the tower above him cried Ettarre,

`Bind him, and bring him in.'


                            He heard her voice;

Then let the strong hand, which had overthrown

Her minion-knights, by those he overthrew

Be bounden straight, and so they brought him in.


Then when he came before Ettarre, the sight

Of her rich beauty made him at one glance

More bondsman in his heart than in his bonds.

Yet with good cheer he spake, `Behold me, Lady,

A prisoner, and the vassal of thy will;

And if thou keep me in thy donjon here,

Content am I so that I see thy face

But once a day:  for I have sworn my vows,

And thou hast given thy promise, and I know

That all these pains are trials of my faith,

And that thyself, when thou hast seen me strained

And sifted to the utmost, wilt at length

Yield me thy love and know me for thy knight.'


Then she began to rail so bitterly,

With all her damsels, he was stricken mute;

But when she mocked his vows and the great King,

Lighted on words:  `For pity of thine own self,

Peace, Lady, peace:  is he not thine and mine?'

`Thou fool,' she said, `I never heard his voice

But longed to break away.  Unbind him now,

And thrust him out of doors; for save he be

Fool to the midmost marrow of his bones,

He will return no more.'  And those, her three,

Laughed, and unbound, and thrust him from the gate.


And after this, a week beyond, again

She called them, saying, `There he watches yet,

There like a dog before his master's door!

Kicked, he returns:  do ye not hate him, ye?

Ye know yourselves:  how can ye bide at peace,

Affronted with his fulsome innocence?

Are ye but creatures of the board and bed,

No men to strike?  Fall on him all at once,

And if ye slay him I reck not:  if ye fail,

Give ye the slave mine order to be bound,

Bind him as heretofore, and bring him in:

It may be ye shall slay him in his bonds.'


She spake; and at her will they couched their spears,

Three against one:  and Gawain passing by,

Bound upon solitary adventure, saw

Low down beneath the shadow of those towers

A villainy, three to one:  and through his heart

The fire of honour and all noble deeds

Flashed, and he called, `I strike upon thy side--

The caitiffs!'  `Nay,' said Pelleas, `but forbear;

He needs no aid who doth his lady's will.'


So Gawain, looking at the villainy done,

Forbore, but in his heat and eagerness

Trembled and quivered, as the dog, withheld

A moment from the vermin that he sees

Before him, shivers, ere he springs and kills.


And Pelleas overthrew them, one to three;

And they rose up, and bound, and brought him in.

Then first her anger, leaving Pelleas, burned

Full on her knights in many an evil name

Of craven, weakling, and thrice-beaten hound:

`Yet, take him, ye that scarce are fit to touch,

Far less to bind, your victor, and thrust him out,

And let who will release him from his bonds.

And if he comes again'--there she brake short;

And Pelleas answered, `Lady, for indeed

I loved you and I deemed you beautiful,

I cannot brook to see your beauty marred

Through evil spite:  and if ye love me not,

I cannot bear to dream you so forsworn:

I had liefer ye were worthy of my love,

Than to be loved again of you--farewell;

And though ye kill my hope, not yet my love,

Vex not yourself:  ye will not see me more.'


While thus he spake, she gazed upon the man

Of princely bearing, though in bonds, and thought,

`Why have I pushed him from me? this man loves,

If love there be:  yet him I loved not.  Why?

I deemed him fool? yea, so? or that in him

A something--was it nobler than myself?

Seemed my reproach?  He is not of my kind.

He could not love me, did he know me well.

Nay, let him go--and quickly.'  And her knights

Laughed not, but thrust him bounden out of door.


Forth sprang Gawain, and loosed him from his bonds,

And flung them o'er the walls; and afterward,

Shaking his hands, as from a lazar's rag,

`Faith of my body,' he said, `and art thou not--

Yea thou art he, whom late our Arthur made

Knight of his table; yea and he that won

The circlet? wherefore hast thou so defamed

Thy brotherhood in me and all the rest,

As let these caitiffs on thee work their will?'


And Pelleas answered, `O, their wills are hers

For whom I won the circlet; and mine, hers,

Thus to be bounden, so to see her face,

Marred though it be with spite and mockery now,

Other than when I found her in the woods;

And though she hath me bounden but in spite,

And all to flout me, when they bring me in,

Let me be bounden, I shall see her face;

Else must I die through mine unhappiness.'


And Gawain answered kindly though in scorn,

`Why, let my lady bind me if she will,

And let my lady beat me if she will:

But an she send her delegate to thrall

These fighting hands of mine--Christ kill me then

But I will slice him handless by the wrist,

And let my lady sear the stump for him,

Howl as he may.  But hold me for your friend:

Come, ye know nothing:  here I pledge my troth,

Yea, by the honour of the Table Round,

I will be leal to thee and work thy work,

And tame thy jailing princess to thine hand.

Lend me thine horse and arms, and I will say

That I have slain thee.  She will let me in

To hear the manner of thy fight and fall;

Then, when I come within her counsels, then

From prime to vespers will I chant thy praise

As prowest knight and truest lover, more

Than any have sung thee living, till she long

To have thee back in lusty life again,

Not to be bound, save by white bonds and warm,

Dearer than freedom.  Wherefore now thy horse

And armour:  let me go:  be comforted:

Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope

The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.'


Then Pelleas lent his horse and all his arms,

Saving the goodly sword, his prize, and took

Gawain's, and said, `Betray me not, but help--

Art thou not he whom men call light-of-love?'


`Ay,' said Gawain, `for women be so light.'

Then bounded forward to the castle walls,

And raised a bugle hanging from his neck,

And winded it, and that so musically

That all the old echoes hidden in the wall

Rang out like hollow woods at hunting-tide.


Up ran a score of damsels to the tower;

`Avaunt,' they cried, `our lady loves thee not.'

But Gawain lifting up his vizor said,

`Gawain am I, Gawain of Arthur's court,

And I have slain this Pelleas whom ye hate:

Behold his horse and armour.  Open gates,

And I will make you merry.'


                          And down they ran,

Her damsels, crying to their lady, `Lo!

Pelleas is dead--he told us--he that hath

His horse and armour:  will ye let him in?

He slew him!  Gawain, Gawain of the court,

Sir Gawain--there he waits below the wall,

Blowing his bugle as who should say him nay.'


And so, leave given, straight on through open door

Rode Gawain, whom she greeted courteously.

`Dead, is it so?' she asked.  `Ay, ay,' said he,

`And oft in dying cried upon your name.'

`Pity on him,' she answered, `a good knight,

But never let me bide one hour at peace.'

`Ay,' thought Gawain, `and you be fair enow:

But I to your dead man have given my troth,

That whom ye loathe, him will I make you love.'


So those three days, aimless about the land,

Lost in a doubt, Pelleas wandering

Waited, until the third night brought a moon

With promise of large light on woods and ways.


Hot was the night and silent; but a sound

Of Gawain ever coming, and this lay--

Which Pelleas had heard sung before the Queen,

And seen her sadden listening--vext his heart,

And marred his rest--`A worm within the rose.'


`A rose, but one, none other rose had I,

A rose, one rose, and this was wondrous fair,

One rose, a rose that gladdened earth and sky,

One rose, my rose, that sweetened all mine air--

I cared not for the thorns; the thorns were there.


`One rose, a rose to gather by and by,

One rose, a rose, to gather and to wear,

No rose but one--what other rose had I?

One rose, my rose; a rose that will not die,--

He dies who loves it,--if the worm be there.'


This tender rhyme, and evermore the doubt,

`Why lingers Gawain with his golden news?'

So shook him that he could not rest, but rode

Ere midnight to her walls, and bound his horse

Hard by the gates.  Wide open were the gates,

And no watch kept; and in through these he past,

And heard but his own steps, and his own heart

Beating, for nothing moved but his own self,

And his own shadow.  Then he crost the court,

And spied not any light in hall or bower,

But saw the postern portal also wide

Yawning; and up a slope of garden, all

Of roses white and red, and brambles mixt

And overgrowing them, went on, and found,

Here too, all hushed below the mellow moon,

Save that one rivulet from a tiny cave

Came lightening downward, and so spilt itself

Among the roses, and was lost again.


Then was he ware of three pavilions reared

Above the bushes, gilden-peakt:  in one,

Red after revel, droned her lurdane knights

Slumbering, and their three squires across their feet:

In one, their malice on the placid lip

Frozen by sweet sleep, four of her damsels lay:

And in the third, the circlet of the jousts

Bound on her brow, were Gawain and Ettarre.


Back, as a hand that pushes through the leaf

To find a nest and feels a snake, he drew:

Back, as a coward slinks from what he fears

To cope with, or a traitor proven, or hound

Beaten, did Pelleas in an utter shame

Creep with his shadow through the court again,

Fingering at his sword-handle until he stood

There on the castle-bridge once more, and thought,

`I will go back, and slay them where they lie.'


And so went back, and seeing them yet in sleep

Said, `Ye, that so dishallow the holy sleep,

Your sleep is death,' and drew the sword, and thought,

`What! slay a sleeping knight? the King hath bound

And sworn me to this brotherhood;' again,

`Alas that ever a knight should be so false.'

Then turned, and so returned, and groaning laid

The naked sword athwart their naked throats,

There left it, and them sleeping; and she lay,

The circlet of her tourney round her brows,

And the sword of the tourney across her throat.


And forth he past, and mounting on his horse

Stared at her towers that, larger than themselves

In their own darkness, thronged into the moon.

Then crushed the saddle with his thighs, and clenched

His hands, and maddened with himself and moaned:


`Would they have risen against me in their blood

At the last day?  I might have answered them

Even before high God.  O towers so strong,

Huge, solid, would that even while I gaze

The crack of earthquake shivering to your base

Split you, and Hell burst up your harlot roofs

Bellowing, and charred you through and through within,

Black as the harlot's heart--hollow as a skull!

Let the fierce east scream through your eyelet-holes,

And whirl the dust of harlots round and round

In dung and nettles! hiss, snake--I saw him there--

Let the fox bark, let the wolf yell.  Who yells

Here in the still sweet summer night, but I--

I, the poor Pelleas whom she called her fool?

Fool, beast--he, she, or I? myself most fool;

Beast too, as lacking human wit--disgraced,

Dishonoured all for trial of true love--

Love?--we be all alike:  only the King

Hath made us fools and liars.  O noble vows!

O great and sane and simple race of brutes

That own no lust because they have no law!

For why should I have loved her to my shame?

I loathe her, as I loved her to my shame.

I never loved her, I but lusted for her--

Away--'

      He dashed the rowel into his horse,

And bounded forth and vanished through the night.


Then she, that felt the cold touch on her throat,

Awaking knew the sword, and turned herself

To Gawain:  `Liar, for thou hast not slain

This Pelleas! here he stood, and might have slain

Me and thyself.'  And he that tells the tale

Says that her ever-veering fancy turned

To Pelleas, as the one true knight on earth,

And only lover; and through her love her life

Wasted and pined, desiring him in vain.


But he by wild and way, for half the night,

And over hard and soft, striking the sod

From out the soft, the spark from off the hard,

Rode till the star above the wakening sun,

Beside that tower where Percivale was cowled,

Glanced from the rosy forehead of the dawn.

For so the words were flashed into his heart

He knew not whence or wherefore:  `O sweet star,

Pure on the virgin forehead of the dawn!'

And there he would have wept, but felt his eyes

Harder and drier than a fountain bed

In summer:  thither came the village girls

And lingered talking, and they come no more

Till the sweet heavens have filled it from the heights

Again with living waters in the change

Of seasons:  hard his eyes; harder his heart

Seemed; but so weary were his limbs, that he,

Gasping, `Of Arthur's hall am I, but here,

Here let me rest and die,' cast himself down,

And gulfed his griefs in inmost sleep; so lay,

Till shaken by a dream, that Gawain fired

The hall of Merlin, and the morning star

Reeled in the smoke, brake into flame, and fell.


He woke, and being ware of some one nigh,

Sent hands upon him, as to tear him, crying,

`False! and I held thee pure as Guinevere.'


But Percivale stood near him and replied,

`Am I but false as Guinevere is pure?

Or art thou mazed with dreams? or being one

Of our free-spoken Table hast not heard

That Lancelot'--there he checked himself and paused.


Then fared it with Sir Pelleas as with one

Who gets a wound in battle, and the sword

That made it plunges through the wound again,

And pricks it deeper:  and he shrank and wailed,

`Is the Queen false?' and Percivale was mute.

`Have any of our Round Table held their vows?'

And Percivale made answer not a word.

`Is the King true?'  `The King!' said Percivale.

`Why then let men couple at once with wolves.

What! art thou mad?'


                   But Pelleas, leaping up,

Ran through the doors and vaulted on his horse

And fled:  small pity upon his horse had he,

Or on himself, or any, and when he met

A cripple, one that held a hand for alms--

Hunched as he was, and like an old dwarf-elm

That turns its back upon the salt blast, the boy

Paused not, but overrode him, shouting, `False,

And false with Gawain!' and so left him bruised

And battered, and fled on, and hill and wood

Went ever streaming by him till the gloom,

That follows on the turning of the world,

Darkened the common path:  he twitched the reins,

And made his beast that better knew it, swerve

Now off it and now on; but when he saw

High up in heaven the hall that Merlin built,

Blackening against the dead-green stripes of even,

`Black nest of rats,' he groaned, `ye build too high.'


Not long thereafter from the city gates

Issued Sir Lancelot riding airily,

Warm with a gracious parting from the Queen,

Peace at his heart, and gazing at a star

And marvelling what it was:  on whom the boy,

Across the silent seeded meadow-grass

Borne, clashed:  and Lancelot, saying, `What name hast thou

That ridest here so blindly and so hard?'

`No name, no name,' he shouted, `a scourge am I

To lash the treasons of the Table Round.'

`Yea, but thy name?'  `I have many names,' he cried:

`I am wrath and shame and hate and evil fame,

And like a poisonous wind I pass to blast

And blaze the crime of Lancelot and the Queen.'

`First over me,' said Lancelot, `shalt thou pass.'

`Fight therefore,' yelled the youth, and either knight

Drew back a space, and when they closed, at once

The weary steed of Pelleas floundering flung

His rider, who called out from the dark field,

`Thou art as false as Hell:  slay me:  I have no sword.'

Then Lancelot, `Yea, between thy lips--and sharp;

But here I will disedge it by thy death.'

`Slay then,' he shrieked, `my will is to be slain,'

And Lancelot, with his heel upon the fallen,

Rolling his eyes, a moment stood, then spake:

`Rise, weakling; I am Lancelot; say thy say.'


And Lancelot slowly rode his warhorse back

To Camelot, and Sir Pelleas in brief while

Caught his unbroken limbs from the dark field,

And followed to the city.  It chanced that both

Brake into hall together, worn and pale.

There with her knights and dames was Guinevere.

Full wonderingly she gazed on Lancelot

So soon returned, and then on Pelleas, him

Who had not greeted her, but cast himself

Down on a bench, hard-breathing.  `Have ye fought?'

She asked of Lancelot.  `Ay, my Queen,' he said.

`And hast thou overthrown him?'  `Ay, my Queen.'

Then she, turning to Pelleas, `O young knight,

Hath the great heart of knighthood in thee failed

So far thou canst not bide, unfrowardly,

A fall from HIM?'  Then, for he answered not,

`Or hast thou other griefs?  If I, the Queen,

May help them, loose thy tongue, and let me know.'

But Pelleas lifted up an eye so fierce

She quailed; and he, hissing `I have no sword,'

Sprang from the door into the dark.  The Queen

Looked hard upon her lover, he on her;

And each foresaw the dolorous day to be:

And all talk died, as in a grove all song

Beneath the shadow of some bird of prey;

Then a long silence came upon the hall,

And Modred thought, `The time is hard at hand.'

Poem 102: Princess: A Medley: The splendour falls on castle walls

The splendour falls on castle walls

And snowy summits old in story:

The long light shakes across the lakes,

And the wild cataract leaps in glory.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,

And thinner, clearer, farther going!

O sweet and far from cliff and scar

The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!

Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.


O love, they die in yon rich sky,

They faint on hill or field or river:

Our echoes roll from soul to soul,

And grow for ever and for ever.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

Poem 103: Recollection of the Arabian Nights

WHEN the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free

In the silken sail of infancy,

The tide of time flow'd back with me,

The forward-flowing tide of time;

And many a sheeny summer-morn,

Adown the Tigris I was borne,

By Bagdat's shrines of fretted gold,

High-walled gardens green and old;

True Mussulman was I and sworn,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Anight my shallop, rustling thro'

The low and bloomed foliage, drove

The fragrant, glistening deeps, and clove

The citron-shadows in the blue:

By garden porches on the brim,

The costly doors flung open wide,

Gold glittering thro' lamplight dim,

And broider'd sofas on each side:

    In sooth it was a goodly time,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Often where clear-stemm'd platans guard

The outlet, did I turn away

The boat-head down a broad canal

From the main river sluiced, where all

The sloping of the moon-lit sward

Was damask-work, and deep inlay

Of braided blooms unmown, which crept

Adown to where the water slept.

    A goodly place, a goodly time,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


A motion from the river won

Ridged the smooth level, bearing on

My shallop thro' the star-strown calm,

Until another night in night

I enter'd, from the clearer light,

Imbower'd vaults of pillar'd palm,

Imprisoning sweets, which, as they clomb

Heavenward, were stay'd beneath the dome

    Of hollow boughs.--A goodly time,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Still onward; and the clear canal

Is rounded to as clear a lake.

From the green rivage many a fall

Of diamond rillets musical,

Thro' little crystal arches low

Down from the central fountain's flow

Fall'n silver-chiming, seemed to shake

The sparkling flints beneath the prow.

    A goodly place, a goodly time,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Above thro' many a bowery turn

A walk with vary-colour'd shells

Wander'd engrain'd.  On either side

All round about the fragrant marge

From fluted vase, and brazen urn

In order, eastern flowers large,

Some dropping low their crimson bells

Half-closed, and others studded wide

    With disks and tiars, fed the time

    With odour in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Far off, and where the lemon grove

In closest coverture upsprung,

The living airs of middle night

Died round the bulbul as he sung;

Not he: but something which possess'd

The darkness of the world, delight,

Life, anguish, death, immortal love,

Ceasing not, mingled, unrepress'd,

    Apart from place, withholding time,

    But flattering the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Black the garden-bowers and grots

Slumber'd: the solemn palms were ranged

Above, unwoo'd of summer wind:

A sudden splendour from behind

Flush'd all the leaves with rich gold-green,

And, flowing rapidly between

Their interspaces, counterchanged

The level lake with diamond-plots

    Of dark and bright. A lovely time,

    For it was in the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Dark-blue the deep sphere overhead,

Distinct with vivid stars inlaid,

Grew darker from that under-flame:

So, leaping lightly from the boat,

With silver anchor left afloat,

In marvel whence that glory came

Upon me, as in sleep I sank

In cool soft turf upon the bank,

    Entranced with that place and time,

    So worthy of the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Thence thro' the garden I was drawn--

A realm of pleasance, many a mound,

And many a shadow-chequer'd lawn

Full of the city's stilly sound,

And deep myrrh-thickets blowing round

The stately cedar, tamarisks,

Thick rosaries of scented thorn,

Tall orient shrubs, and obelisks

    Graven with emblems of the time,

    In honour of the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


With dazed vision unawares

From the long alley's latticed shade

Emerged, I came upon the great

Pavilion of the Caliphat.

Right to the carven cedarn doors,

Flung inward over spangled floors,

Broad-based flights of marble stairs

Ran up with golden balustrade,

    After the fashion of the time,

    And humour of the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


The fourscore windows all alight

As with the quintessence of flame,

A million tapers flaring bright

From twisted silvers look'd to shame

The hollow-vaulted dark, and stream'd

Upon the mooned domes aloof

In inmost Bagdat, till there seem'd

Hundreds of crescents on the roof

    Of night new-risen, that marvellous time

    To celebrate the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Then stole I up, and trancedly

Gazed on the Persian girl alone,

Serene with argent-lidded eyes

Amorous, and lashes like to rays

Of darkness, and a brow of pearl

Tressed with redolent ebony,

In many a dark delicious curl,

Flowing beneath her rose-hued zone;

    The sweetest lady of the time,

    Well worthy of the golden prime

         Of good Haroun Alraschid.


Six columns, three on either side,

Pure silver, underpropt a rich

Throne of the massive ore, from which

Down-droop'd, in many a floating fold,

Engarlanded and diaper'd

With inwrought flowers, a cloth of gold.

Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd

With merriment of kingly pride,

    Sole star of all that place and time,

    I saw him--in his golden prime,

         The good Haroun Alraschid.

Poem 104: Requiescat

Fair is her cottage in its place,

 Where yon broad water sweetly slowly glides.

It sees itself from thatch to base

 Dream in the sliding tides.


And fairer she, but ah how soon to die!

 Her quiet dream of life this hour may cease.

Her peaceful being slowly passes by

 To some more perfect peace.

Poem 105: Ring Out, Wild Bells

Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,

The flying cloud, the frosty light;

The year is dying in the night;

Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.


Ring out the old, ring in the new,

Ring, happy bells, across the snow:

The year is going, let him go;

Ring out the false, ring in the true.


Ring out the grief that saps the mind,

For those that here we see no more,

Ring out the feud of rich and poor,

Ring in redress to all mankind.


Ring out a slowly dying cause,

And ancient forms of party strife;

Ring in the nobler modes of life,

With sweeter manners, purer laws.


Ring out the want, the care, the sin,

The faithless coldness of the times;

Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,

But ring the fuller minstrel in.


Ring out false pride in place and blood,

The civic slander and the spite;

Ring in the love of truth and right,

Ring in the common love of good.


Ring out old shapes of foul disease,

Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;

Ring out the thousand wars of old,

Ring in the thousand years of peace.


Ring in the valiant man and free,

The larger heart, the kindlier hand;

Ring out the darkness of the land,

Ring in the Christ that is to be.

Poem 106: Sea Dreams

A city clerk, but gently born and bred;

His wife, an unknown artist's orphan child--

One babe was theirs, a Margaret, three years old:

They, thinking that her clear germander eye

Droopt in the giant-factoried city-gloom,

Came, with a month's leave given them, to the sea:

For which his gains were dock'd, however small:

Small were his gains, and hard his work; besides,

Their slender household fortunes (for the man

Had risk'd his little) like the little thrift,

Trembled in perilous places o'er a deep:

And oft, when sitting all alone, his face

Would darken, as he cursed his credulousness,

And that one unctuous mount which lured him, rogue,

To buy strange shares in some Peruvian mine.

Now seaward-bound for health they gain'd a coast,

All sand and cliff and deep-inrunning cave,

At close of day; slept, woke, and went the next,

The Sabbath, pious variers from the church,

To chapel; where a heated pulpiteer,

Not preaching simple Christ to simple men,

Announced the coming doom, and fulminated

Against the scarlet woman and her creed:

For sideways up he swung his arms, and shriek'd

`Thus, thus with violence,' ev'n as if he held

The Apocalyptic millstone, and himself

Were that great Angel; `Thus with violence

Shall Babylon be cast into the sea;

Then comes the close.'  The gentle-hearted wife

Sat shuddering at the ruin of a world;

He at his own: but when the wordy storm

Had ended, forth they came and paced the shore,

Ran in and out the long sea-framing caves,

Drank the large air, and saw, but scarce believed

(The sootflake of so many a summer still

Clung to their fancies) that they saw, the sea.

So now on sand they walk'd, and now on cliff,

Lingering about the thymy promontories,

Till all the sails were darken'd in the west,

And rosed in the east: then homeward and to bed:

Where she, who kept a tender Christian hope

Haunting a holy text, and still to that

Returning, as the bird returns, at night,

`Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,'

Said, `Love, forgive him:' but he did not speak;

And silenced by that silence lay the wife,

Remembering her dear Lord who died for all,

And musing on the little lives of men,

And how they mar this little by their feuds.


 But while the two were sleeping, a full tide

Rose with ground-swell, which, on the foremost rocks

Touching, upjetted in spirts of wild sea-smoke,

And scaled in sheets of wasteful foam, and fell

In vast sea-cataracts--ever and anon

Dead claps of thunder from within the cliffs

Heard thro' the living roar.  At this the babe,

Their Margaret cradled near them, wail'd and woke

The mother, and the father suddenly cried,

`A wreck, a wreck!' then turn'd, and groaning said,


 `Forgive!  How many will say, "forgive," and find

A sort of absolution in the sound

To hate a little longer!  No; the sin

That neither God nor man can well forgive,

Hypocrisy, I saw it in him at once.

Is it so true that second thoughts are best?

Not first, and third, which are a riper first?

Too ripe, too late! they come too late for use.

Ah love, there surely lives in man and beast

Something divine to warn them of their foes:

And such a sense, when first I fronted him,

Said, "trust him not;" but after, when I came

To know him more, I lost it, knew him less;

Fought with what seem'd my own uncharity;

Sat at his table; drank his costly wines;

Made more and more allowance for his talk;

Went further, fool! and trusted him with all,

All my poor scrapings from a dozen years

Of dust and deskwork: there is no such mine,

None; but a gulf of ruin, swallowing gold,

Not making.  Ruin'd! ruin'd! the sea roars

Ruin: a fearful night!'


     `Not fearful; fair,'

Said the good wife, `if every star in heaven

Can make it fair: you do but bear the tide.

Had you ill dreams?'


   `O yes,' he said, `I dream'd

Of such a tide swelling toward the land,

And I from out the boundless outer deep

Swept with it to the shore, and enter'd one

Of those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs.

I thought the motion of the boundless deep

Bore through the cave, and I was heaved upon it

In darkness: then I saw one lovely star

Larger and larger.  "What a world," I thought,

"To live in!" but in moving I found

Only the landward exit of the cave,

Bright with the sun upon the stream beyond:

And near the light a giant woman sat,

All over earthy, like a piece of earth,

A pickaxe in her hand: then out I slipt

Into a land all of sun and blossom, trees

As high as heaven, and every bird that sings:

And here the night-light flickering in my eyes

Awoke me.'


  `That was then your dream,' she said,

`Not sad, but sweet.'


   `So sweet, I lay,' said he,

`And mused upon it, drifting up the stream

In fancy, till I slept again, and pieced

The broken vision; for I dream'd that still

The motion of the great deep bore me on,

And that the woman walk'd upon the brink:

I wonder'd at her strength, and ask'd her of it:

"It came," she said, "by working in the mines:"

O then to ask her of my shares, I thought;

And ask'd; but not a word; she shook her head.

And then the motion of the current ceased,

And there was rolling thunder; and we reach'd

A mountain, like a wall of burs and thorns;

But she with her strong feet up the steep hill

Trod out a path: I follow'd; and at top

She pointed seaward: there a fleet of glass,

That seem'd a fleet of jewels under me,

Sailing along before a gloomy cloud

That not one moment ceased to thunder, past

In sunshine: right across its track there lay,

Down in the water, a long reef of gold,

Or what seem'd gold: and I was glad at first

To think that in our often-ransack'd world

Still so much gold was left; and then I fear'd

Lest the gay navy there should splinter on it,

And fearing waved my arm to warn them off;

An idle signal, for the brittle fleet

(I thought I could have died to save it) near'd,

Touch'd, clink'd, and clash'd, and vanish'd, and I woke,

I heard the clash so clearly.  Now I see

My dream was Life; the woman honest Work;

And my poor venture but a fleet of glass

Wreck'd on a reef of visionary gold.'


 `Nay,' said the kindly wife to comfort him,

`You raised your arm, you tumbled down and broke

The glass with little Margaret's medicine it it;

And, breaking that, you made and broke your dream:

A trifle makes a dream, a trifle breaks.'


 `No trifle,' groan'd the husband; `yesterday

I met him suddenly in the street, and ask'd

That which I ask'd the woman in my dream.

Like her, he shook his head.  "Show me the books!"

He dodged me with a long and loose account.

"The books, the books!" but he, he could not wait,

Bound on a matter he of life and death:

When the great Books (see Daniel seven and ten)

Were open'd, I should find he meant me well;

And then began to bloat himself, and ooze

All over with the fat affectionate smile

That makes the widow lean.  "My dearest friend,

Have faith, have faith!  We live by faith," said he;

"And all things work together for the good

Of those"--it makes me sick to quote him--last

Gript my hand hard, and with God-bless-you went.

I stood like one that had received a blow:

I found a hard friend in his loose accounts,

A loose one in the hard grip of his hand,

A curse in his God-bless-you: then my eyes

Pursued him down the street, and far away,

Among the honest shoulders of the crowd,

Read rascal in the motions of his back,

And scoundrel in the supple-sliding knee.'


 `Was he so bound, poor soul?' said the good wife;

`So are we all: but do not call him, love,

Before you prove him, rogue, and proved, forgive.

His gain is loss; for he that wrongs his friend

Wrongs himself more, and ever bears about

A silent court of justice in his breast,

Himself the judge and jury, and himself

The prisoner at the bar, ever condemn'd:

And that drags down his life: then comes what comes

Hereafter: and he meant, he said he meant,

Perhaps he meant, or partly meant, you well.'


 ` "With all his conscience and one eye askew"--

Love, let me quote these lines, that you may learn

A man is likewise counsel for himself,

Too often, in that silent court of yours--

"With all his conscience and one eye askew,

So false, he partly took himself for true;

Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,

Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;

Who, never naming God except for gain,

So never took that useful name in vain;

Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,

And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;

Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,

And snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged;

And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest

Arising, did his holy oily best,

Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,

To spread the Word by which himself had thriven."

How like you this old satire?'


     `Nay,' she said

`I loathe it: he had never kindly heart,

Nor ever cared to better his own kind,

Who first wrote satire, with no pity in it.

But will you hear MY dream, for I had one

That altogether went to music?  Still

It awed me.'


    Then she told it, having dream'd

Of that same coast.


   --But round the North, a light,

A belt, it seem'd, of luminous vapor, lay,

And ever in it a low musical note

Swell'd up and died; and, as it swell'd, a ridge

Of breaker issued from the belt, and still

Grew with the growing note, and when the note

Had reach'd a thunderous fullness, on those cliffs

Broke, mixt with awful light (the same as that

Living within the belt) whereby she saw

That all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more,

But huge cathedral fronts of every age,

Grave, florid, stern, as far as eye could see.

One after one: and then the great ridge drew,

Lessening to the lessening music, back,

And past into the belt and swell'd again

Slowly to music: ever when it broke

The statues, king or saint, or founder fell;

Then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left

Came men and women in dark clusters round,

Some crying, "Set them up! they shall not fall!"

And others "Let them lie, for they have fall'n."

And still they strove and wrangled: and she grieved

In her strange dream, she knew not why, to find

Their wildest wailings never out of tune

With that sweet note; and ever as their shrieks

Ran highest up the gamut, that great wave

Returning, while none mark'd it, on the crowd

Broke, mixt with awful light, and show'd their eyes

Glaring, and passionate looks, and swept away

The men of flesh and blood, and men of stone,

To the waste deeps together.


   `Then I fixt

My wistful eyes on two fair images,

Both crown'd with stars and high among the stars,--

The Virgin Mother standing with her child

High up on one of those dark minster-fronts--

Till she began to totter, and the child

Clung to the mother, and sent out a cry

Which mixt with little Margaret's, and I woke,

And my dream awed me:--well--but what are dreams?

Yours came but from the breaking of a glass,

And mine but from the crying of a child.'


 `Child?  No!' said he, `but this tide's roar, and his,

Our Boanerges with his threats of doom,

And loud-lung'd Antibabylonianisms

(Altho' I grant but little music there)

Went both to make your dream: but if there were

A music harmonizing our wild cries,

Sphere-music such as that you dream'd about,

Why, that would make our passions far too like

The discords dear to the musician.  No--

One shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven:

True Devils with no ear, they howl in tune

With nothing but the Devil!'


   `"True" indeed!

One of our town, but later by an hour

Here than ourselves, spoke with me on the shore;

While you were running down the sands, and made

The dimpled flounce of the sea-furbelow flap,

Good man, to please the child.  She brought strange news.

Why were you silent when I spoke to-night?

I had set my heart on your forgiving him

Before you knew.  We MUST forgive the dead.'


 `Dead! who is dead?'


      `The man your eye pursued.

A little after you had parted with him,

He suddenly dropt dead of heart-disease.'


 `Dead? he? of heart-disease? what heart had he

To die of? dead!'


 `Ah, dearest, if there be

A devil in man, there is an angel too,

And if he did that wrong you charge him with,

His angel broke his heart.  But your rough voice

(You spoke so loud) has roused the child again.

Sleep, little birdie, sleep! will she not sleep

Without her "little birdie?" well then, sleep,

And I will sing you "birdie."'


     Saying this,

The woman half turn'd round from him she loved,

Left him one hand, and reaching thro' the night

Her other, found (for it was close beside)

And half embraced the basket cradle-head

With one soft arm, which, like the pliant bough

That moving moves the nest and nestling, sway'd

The cradle, while she sang this baby song.


 What does the little birdie say

 In her nest at peep of day?

 Let me fly, says little birdie,

 Mother, let me fly away.

 Birdie, rest a little longer,

 Till the little wings are stronger.

 So she rests a little longer,

 Then she flies away.


 What does little baby say,

 In her bed at peep of day?

 Baby says, like little birdie,

 Let me rise and fly away.

 Baby, sleep a little longer,

 Till the little limbs are stronger.

 If she sleeps a little longer,

 Baby too shall fly away.


`She sleeps: let us too, let all evil, sleep.

He also sleeps--another sleep than ours.

He can do no more wrong: forgive him, dear,

And I shall sleep the sounder!'


     Then the man,

`His deeds yet live, the worst is yet to come.

Yet let your sleep for this one night be sound:

I do forgive him!'


  `Thanks, my love,' she said,

`Your own will be the sweeter,' and they slept.

Poem 107: Sir Galahad

MY good blade carves the casques of men,

     My tough lance thrusteth sure,

My strength is as the strength of ten,

     Because my heart is pure.

The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,

     The hard brands shiver on the steel,

The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,

     The horse and rider reel:

They reel, they roll in clanging lists,

     And when the tide of combat stands,

Perfume and flowers fall in showers,

     That lightly rain from ladies' hands.


How sweet are looks that ladies bend

     On whom their favours fall !

For them I battle till the end,

     To save from shame and thrall:

But all my heart is drawn above,

     My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:

I never felt the kiss of love,

     Nor maiden's hand in mine.

More bounteous aspects on me beam,

     Me mightier transports move and thrill;

So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer

     A virgin heart in work and will.


When down the stormy crescent goes,

     A light before me swims,

Between dark stems the forest glows,

     I hear a noise of hymns:

Then by some secret shrine I ride;

     I hear a voice but none are there;

The stalls are void, the doors are wide,

     The tapers burning fair.

Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,

     The silver vessels sparkle clean,

The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,

     And solemn chaunts resound between.


Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres

     I find a magic bark;

I leap on board: no helmsman steers:

     I float till all is dark.

A gentle sound, an awful light !

     Three angels bear the holy Grail:

With folded feet, in stoles of white,

     On sleeping wings they sail.

Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!

     My spirit beats her mortal bars,

As down dark tides the glory slides,

     And star-like mingles with the stars.


When on my goodly charger borne

     Thro' dreaming towns I go,

The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,

     The streets are dumb with snow.

The tempest crackles on the leads,

     And, ringing, springs from brand and mail;

But o'er the dark a glory spreads,

     And gilds the driving hail.

I leave the plain, I climb the height;

     No branchy thicket shelter yields;

But blessed forms in whistling storms

     Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.


A maiden knight--to me is given

     Such hope, I know not fear;

I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven

     That often meet me here.

I muse on joy that will not cease,

     Pure spaces clothed in living beams,

Pure lilies of eternal peace,

     Whose odours haunt my dreams;

And, stricken by an angel's hand,

     This mortal armour that I wear,

This weight and size, this heart and eyes,

     Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.


The clouds are broken in the sky,

     And thro' the mountain-walls

A rolling organ-harmony

     Swells up, and shakes and falls.

Then move the trees, the copses nod,

     Wings flutter, voices hover clear:

'O just and faithful knight of God!

     Ride on ! the prize is near.'

So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;

     By bridge and ford, by park and pale,

All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,

     Until I find the holy Grail.

Poem 108: Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere

LIKE souls that balance joy and pain,

With tears and smiles from heaven again

The maiden Spring upon the plain

Came in a sun-lit fall of rain.

           In crystal vapour everywhere

Blue isles of heaven laugh'd between,

And far, in forest-deeps unseen,

The topmost elm-tree gather'd green

           From draughts of balmy air.


Sometimes the linnet piped his song:

Sometimes the throstle whistled strong:

Sometimes the sparhawk, wheel'd along,

Hush'd all the groves from fear of wrong:

           By grassy capes with fuller sound

In curves the yellowing river ran,

And drooping chestnut-buds began

To spread into the perfect fan,

           Above the teeming ground.


Then, in the boyhood of the year,

Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere

Rode thro' the coverts of the deer,

With blissful treble ringing clear.

           She seem'd a part of joyous Spring:

A gown of grass-green silk she wore,

Buckled with golden clasps before;

A light-green tuft of plumes she bore

           Closed in a golden ring.


Now on some twisted ivy-net,

Now by some tinkling rivulet,

In mosses mixt with violet

Her cream-white mule his pastern set:

           And fleeter now she skimm'd the plains

Than she whose elfin prancer springs

By night to eery warblings,

When all the glimmering moorland rings

           With jingling bridle-reins.


As she fled fast thro' sun and shade,

The happy winds upon her play'd,

Blowing the ringlet from the braid:

She look'd so lovely, as she sway'd

           The rein with dainty finger-tips,

A man had given all other bliss,

And all his worldly worth for this,

To waste his whole heart in one kiss

           Upon her perfect lips.

Poem 110: St. Agnes' Eve

Deep on the convent-roof the snows

      Are sparkling to the moon:

My breath to heaven like vapour goes;

      May my soul follow soon!

The shadows of the convent-towers

      Slant down the snowy sward,

Still creeping with the creeping hours

      That lead me to my Lord:

Make Thou my spirit pure and clear

      As are the frosty skies,

Or this first snowdrop of the year

      That in my bosom lies.


As these white robes are soil'd and dark,

      To yonder shining ground;

As this pale taper's earthly spark,

      To yonder argent round;

So shows my soul before the Lamb,

      My spirit before Thee;

So in mine earthly house I am,

      To that I hope to be.

Break up the heavens, O Lord! and far,

      Thro' all yon starlight keen,

Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,

      In raiment white and clean.


He lifts me to the golden doors;

      The flashes come and go;

All heaven bursts her starry floors,

      And strows her lights below,

And deepens on and up! the gates

      Roll back, and far within

For me the Heavenly Bridegroom waits,

      To make me pure of sin.

The sabbaths of Eternity,

      One sabbath deep and wide--

A light upon the shining sea--

      The Bridegroom with his bride!

Poem 112: Tears, Idle Tears

Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,

Tears from the depth of some divine despair

Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,

In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,

And thinking of the days that are no more.


Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,

That brings our friends up from the underworld,

Sad as the last which reddens over one

That sinks with all we love below the verge;

So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.


Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns

The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds

To dying ears, when unto dying eyes

The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;

So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.


Dear as remembered kisses after death,

And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned

On lips that are for others; deep as love,

Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;

O Death in Life, the days that are no more!

Poem 113: The Brook

I come from haunts of coot and hern,

I make a sudden sally

And sparkle out among the fern,

To bicker down a valley.


By thirty hills I hurry down,

Or slip between the ridges,

By twenty thorpes, a little town,

And half a hundred bridges.


Till last by Philip's farm I flow

To join the brimming river,

For men may come and men may go,

But I go on for ever.


I chatter over stony ways,

In little sharps and trebles,

I bubble into eddying bays,

I babble on the pebbles.


With many a curve my banks I fret

By many a field and fallow,

And many a fairy foreland set

With willow-weed and mallow.


I chatter, chatter, as I flow

To join the brimming river,

For men may come and men may go,

But I go on for ever.


I wind about, and in and out,

With here a blossom sailing,

And here and there a lusty trout,

And here and there a grayling,


And here and there a foamy flake

Upon me, as I travel

With many a silvery waterbreak

Above the golden gravel,


And draw them all along, and flow

To join the brimming river

For men may come and men may go,

But I go on for ever.


I steal by lawns and grassy plots,

I slide by hazel covers;

I move the sweet forget-me-nots

That grow for happy lovers.


I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,

Among my skimming swallows;

I make the netted sunbeam dance

Against my sandy shallows.


I murmur under moon and stars

In brambly wildernesses;

I linger by my shingly bars;

I loiter round my cresses;


And out again I curve and flow

To join the brimming river,

For men may come and men may go,

But I go on for ever.

Poem 114: The Charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaclava

I


              The charge of the gallant three hundred, the Heavy

                   Brigade

              Down the hill, down the hill, thousands of Russians,

              Thousands of horsemen, drew to the valley — and

                   stayed;

              For Scarlett and Scarlett's three hundred were riding by

              When the points of the Russian lances arose in the sky;

              And he called ‘Left wheel into line!’ and they wheeled

                   and obeyed.

              Then he looked at the host that had halted he knew

                   not why,

              And he turned half round and he bad his trumpeter

                   sound

              To the charge, and he rode on ahead, as he waved

                   his blade

              To the gallant three hundred those glory will never

                   fade—

              ‘Follow,’ and up the hill, up the hill, up the hill,

              Followed the Heavy Brigade.

              The trumpet, the gallop, the charge, and the might

                   of the fight!

              Thousands of horsemen had gathered there on the

                   height,

              With a wing pushed out to the left, and a wing to the

                   right,

              And who shall escape if they close? but he dashed up

                   alone

              Through the great gray slope of men,

              Swayed his sabre, and held his own

              Like an Englishman there and then;

              All in a moment followed with force

              Three that were next in their fiery course,

              Fought for their lives in the narrow gap they had made—

              Four amid thousands! and up the hill, up the hill,

              Galloped the gallant three hundred, the Heavy Brigade.

              Fell like a cannonshot,

              Burst like a thunderbolt,

              Crashed like a hurricane .

              Broke through the mass from below,

              Drove through the midst of the foe,

              Plunged up and down, to and foe

              Rode flashing blow upon blow,

              Brave Inniskillens and Greys

              Whirling their sabres in circles of light!

              And some of us, all in amaze,

              Who were held for a while from the fight,

              And were only standing at gaze,

              When the dark-muffled Russian crowd

              Folded its wings from the left and the right,

              And rolled them around like a cloud,—

              O mad for the charge and the battle were we,

              When our own good redcoats sank from sight,

              Like drops of blood in a dark-gray sea,

              And we turned to each other, whispering, whispering,

                   all dismayed,

              ‘Lost are the gallant three hundred of Scarlett’s

                   Brigade!’

              ‘Lost one and all’ were the words

              Muttered in our dismay;

              But they rode like Victors and Lords

              Through the forest of lances and swords

              In the heart of the Russian hordes,

              They rode or they stood at bay—

              Struck with the sword-hand and slew,

              Down with the bridle-hand drew

              The foe from the saddle and threw

              Underfoot there in the fray—

              Ranged like a storm or stood like a rock

              In the wave of a stormy day;

              Till suddenly shock upon shock

              Staggered the mass from without,

              Drove it in wild disarray,

              For our men gallopt up with a cheer and a shout,

              And the foeman surged, and wavered, and reeled

              Up the hill, up the hill, up the hill, out of the field,

              And over the brow and away.

Back from the mouth of Hell,

All that was left of them,

     Left of six hundred.


When can their glory fade ?

O the wild charge they made!

Honour the charge they made!

Poem 116: The Coming Of Arthur

Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,

Had one fair daughter, and none other child;

And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,

Guinevere, and in her his one delight.


For many a petty king ere Arthur came

Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war

Each upon other, wasted all the land;

And still from time to time the heathen host

Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.

And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,

Wherein the beast was ever more and more,

But man was less and less, till Arthur came.

For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,

And after him King Uther fought and died,

But either failed to make the kingdom one.

And after these King Arthur for a space,

And through the puissance of his Table Round,

Drew all their petty princedoms under him.

Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.


And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,

Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,

And none or few to scare or chase the beast;

So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear

Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,

And wallowed in the gardens of the King.

And ever and anon the wolf would steal

The children and devour, but now and then,

Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat

To human sucklings; and the children, housed

In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,

And mock their foster mother on four feet,

Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,

Worse than the wolves.  And King Leodogran

Groaned for the Roman legions here again,

And Csar's eagle:  then his brother king,

Urien, assailed him:  last a heathen horde,

Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,

And on the spike that split the mother's heart

Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,

He knew not whither he should turn for aid.


But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,

Though not without an uproar made by those

Who cried, `He is not Uther's son'--the King

Sent to him, saying, `Arise, and help us thou!

For here between the man and beast we die.'


And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,

But heard the call, and came:  and Guinevere

Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;

But since he neither wore on helm or shield

The golden symbol of his kinglihood,

But rode a simple knight among his knights,

And many of these in richer arms than he,

She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,

One among many, though his face was bare.

But Arthur, looking downward as he past,

Felt the light of her eyes into his life

Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched

His tents beside the forest.  Then he drave

The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled

The forest, letting in the sun, and made

Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight

And so returned.


               For while he lingered there,

A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts

Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm

Flashed forth and into war:  for most of these,

Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,

Made head against him, crying, `Who is he

That he should rule us? who hath proven him

King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,

And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,

Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.

This is the son of Gorlos, not the King;

This is the son of Anton, not the King.'


And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt

Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,

Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;

And thinking as he rode, `Her father said

That there between the man and beast they die.

Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts

Up to my throne, and side by side with me?

What happiness to reign a lonely king,

Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,

O earth that soundest hollow under me,

Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined

To her that is the fairest under heaven,

I seem as nothing in the mighty world,

And cannot will my will, nor work my work

Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm

Victor and lord.  But were I joined with her,

Then might we live together as one life,

And reigning with one will in everything

Have power on this dark land to lighten it,

And power on this dead world to make it live.'


Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--

When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright

With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world

Was all so clear about him, that he saw

The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,

And even in high day the morning star.

So when the King had set his banner broad,

At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,

And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,

The long-lanced battle let their horses run.

And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,

And now the King, as here and there that war

Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world

Made lightnings and great thunders over him,

And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,

And mightier of his hands with every blow,

And leading all his knighthood threw the kings

Cardos, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,

Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,

The King Brandagoras of Latangor,

With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,

And Lot of Orkney.  Then, before a voice

As dreadful as the shout of one who sees

To one who sins, and deems himself alone

And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake

Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands

That hacked among the flyers, `Ho! they yield!'

So like a painted battle the war stood

Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,

And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.

He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved

And honoured most.  `Thou dost not doubt me King,

So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'

`Sir and my liege,' he cried, `the fire of God

Descends upon thee in the battle-field:

I know thee for my King!'  Whereat the two,

For each had warded either in the fight,

Sware on the field of death a deathless love.

And Arthur said, `Man's word is God in man:

Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.'


Then quickly from the foughten field he sent

Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,

His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,

Saying, `If I in aught have served thee well,

Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'


Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart

Debating--`How should I that am a king,

However much he holp me at my need,

Give my one daughter saving to a king,

And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called

A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom

He trusted all things, and of him required

His counsel:  `Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'


Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,

`Sir King, there be but two old men that know:

And each is twice as old as I; and one

Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served

King Uther through his magic art; and one

Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,

Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran

Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,

Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote

All things and whatsoever Merlin did

In one great annal-book, where after-years

Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'


To whom the King Leodogran replied,

`O friend, had I been holpen half as well

By this King Arthur as by thee today,

Then beast and man had had their share of me:

But summon here before us yet once more

Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'


Then, when they came before him, the King said,

`I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,

And reason in the chase:  but wherefore now

Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,

Some calling Arthur born of Gorlos,

Others of Anton?  Tell me, ye yourselves,

Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'


And Ulfius and Brastias answered, `Ay.'

Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights

Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--

For bold in heart and act and word was he,

Whenever slander breathed against the King--


`Sir, there be many rumours on this head:

For there be those who hate him in their hearts,

Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,

And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:

And there be those who deem him more than man,

And dream he dropt from heaven:  but my belief

In all this matter--so ye care to learn--

Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time

The prince and warrior Gorlos, he that held

Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,

Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:

And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,

Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,

Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved

To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.

And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:

But she, a stainless wife to Gorlos,

So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,

That Gorlos and King Uther went to war:

And overthrown was Gorlos and slain.

Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged

Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,

Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,

Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,

And there was none to call to but himself.

So, compassed by the power of the King,

Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,

And with a shameful swiftness:  afterward,

Not many moons, King Uther died himself,

Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule

After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.

And that same night, the night of the new year,

By reason of the bitterness and grief

That vext his mother, all before his time

Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born

Delivered at a secret postern-gate

To Merlin, to be holden far apart

Until his hour should come; because the lords

Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,

Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child

Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each

But sought to rule for his own self and hand,

And many hated Uther for the sake

Of Gorlos.  Wherefore Merlin took the child,

And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight

And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife

Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;

And no man knew.  And ever since the lords

Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,

So that the realm has gone to wrack:  but now,

This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)

Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,

Proclaiming, "Here is Uther's heir, your king,"

A hundred voices cried, "Away with him!

No king of ours! a son of Gorlos he,

Or else the child of Anton, and no king,

Or else baseborn."  Yet Merlin through his craft,

And while the people clamoured for a king,

Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords

Banded, and so brake out in open war.'


Then while the King debated with himself

If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,

Or born the son of Gorlos, after death,

Or Uther's son, and born before his time,

Or whether there were truth in anything

Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,

With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,

Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;

Whom as he could, not as he would, the King

Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,


`A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.

Ye come from Arthur's court.  Victor his men

Report him!  Yea, but ye--think ye this king--

So many those that hate him, and so strong,

So few his knights, however brave they be--

Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'


`O King,' she cried, `and I will tell thee:  few,

Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;

For I was near him when the savage yells

Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat

Crowned on the das, and his warriors cried,

"Be thou the king, and we will work thy will

Who love thee."  Then the King in low deep tones,

And simple words of great authority,

Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,

That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some

Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,

Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes

Half-blinded at the coming of a light.


`But when he spake and cheered his Table Round

With large, divine, and comfortable words,

Beyond my tongue to tell thee--I beheld

From eye to eye through all their Order flash

A momentary likeness of the King:

And ere it left their faces, through the cross

And those around it and the Crucified,

Down from the casement over Arthur, smote

Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,

One falling upon each of three fair queens,

Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends

Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright

Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.


`And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit

And hundred winters are but as the hands

Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.


`And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,

Who knows a subtler magic than his own--

Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.

She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,

Whereby to drive the heathen out:  a mist

Of incense curled about her, and her face

Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;

But there was heard among the holy hymns

A voice as of the waters, for she dwells

Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms

May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,

Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.


`There likewise I beheld Excalibur

Before him at his crowning borne, the sword

That rose from out the bosom of the lake,

And Arthur rowed across and took it--rich

With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,

Bewildering heart and eye--the blade so bright

That men are blinded by it--on one side,

Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,

"Take me," but turn the blade and ye shall see,

And written in the speech ye speak yourself,

"Cast me away!"  And sad was Arthur's face

Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,

"Take thou and strike! the time to cast away

Is yet far-off."  So this great brand the king

Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.'


Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought

To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,

Fixing full eyes of question on her face,

`The swallow and the swift are near akin,

But thou art closer to this noble prince,

Being his own dear sister;' and she said,

`Daughter of Gorlos and Ygerne am I;'

`And therefore Arthur's sister?' asked the King.

She answered, `These be secret things,' and signed

To those two sons to pass, and let them be.

And Gawain went, and breaking into song

Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair

Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:

But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,

And there half-heard; the same that afterward

Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.


And then the Queen made answer, `What know I?

For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,

And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark

Was Gorlos, yea and dark was Uther too,

Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair

Beyond the race of Britons and of men.

Moreover, always in my mind I hear

A cry from out the dawning of my life,

A mother weeping, and I hear her say,

"O that ye had some brother, pretty one,

To guard thee on the rough ways of the world."'


`Ay,' said the King, `and hear ye such a cry?

But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?'


`O King!' she cried, `and I will tell thee true:

He found me first when yet a little maid:

Beaten I had been for a little fault

Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran

And flung myself down on a bank of heath,

And hated this fair world and all therein,

And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he--

I know not whether of himself he came,

Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk

Unseen at pleasure--he was at my side,

And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,

And dried my tears, being a child with me.

And many a time he came, and evermore

As I grew greater grew with me; and sad

At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,

Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,

But sweet again, and then I loved him well.

And now of late I see him less and less,

But those first days had golden hours for me,

For then I surely thought he would be king.


`But let me tell thee now another tale:

For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,

Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,

To hear him speak before he left his life.

Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;

And when I entered told me that himself

And Merlin ever served about the King,

Uther, before he died; and on the night

When Uther in Tintagil past away

Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two

Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,

Then from the castle gateway by the chasm

Descending through the dismal night--a night

In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost--

Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps

It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof

A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern

Bright with a shining people on the decks,

And gone as soon as seen.  And then the two

Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,

Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,

Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep

And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged

Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:

And down the wave and in the flame was borne

A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,

Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried "The King!

Here is an heir for Uther!"  And the fringe

Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,

Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,

And all at once all round him rose in fire,

So that the child and he were clothed in fire.

And presently thereafter followed calm,

Free sky and stars:  "And this the same child," he said,

"Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace

Till this were told."  And saying this the seer

Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,

Not ever to be questioned any more

Save on the further side; but when I met

Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--

The shining dragon and the naked child

Descending in the glory of the seas--

He laughed as is his wont, and answered me

In riddling triplets of old time, and said:


`"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!

A young man will be wiser by and by;

An old man's wit may wander ere he die.

Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!

And truth is this to me, and that to thee;

And truth or clothed or naked let it be.

Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:

Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?

From the great deep to the great deep he goes."


`So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou

Fear not to give this King thy only child,

Guinevere:  so great bards of him will sing

Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old

Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,

And echoed by old folk beside their fires

For comfort after their wage-work is done,

Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time

Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn

Though men may wound him that he will not die,

But pass, again to come; and then or now

Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,

Till these and all men hail him for their king.'


She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,

But musing, `Shall I answer yea or nay?'

Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,

Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,

Field after field, up to a height, the peak

Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,

Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope

The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,

Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,

In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,

Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze

And made it thicker; while the phantom king

Sent out at times a voice; and here or there

Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest

Slew on and burnt, crying, `No king of ours,

No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'

Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze

Descended, and the solid earth became

As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,

Crowned.  And Leodogran awoke, and sent

Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,

Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.


Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved

And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth

And bring the Queen;--and watched him from the gates:

And Lancelot past away among the flowers,

(For then was latter April) and returned

Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.

To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,

Chief of the church in Britain, and before

The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King

That morn was married, while in stainless white,

The fair beginners of a nobler time,

And glorying in their vows and him, his knights

Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.

Far shone the fields of May through open door,

The sacred altar blossomed white with May,

The Sun of May descended on their King,

They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,

Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns

A voice as of the waters, while the two

Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:

And Arthur said, `Behold, thy doom is mine.

Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'

To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,

`King and my lord, I love thee to the death!'

And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,

`Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world

Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,

And all this Order of thy Table Round

Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!'


So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine

Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,

In scornful stillness gazing as they past;

Then while they paced a city all on fire

With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,

And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:--


`Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;

Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!

Blow through the living world--"Let the King reign."


`Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur's realm?

Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,

Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.


`Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard

That God hath told the King a secret word.

Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.


`Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.

Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!

Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.


`Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,

The King is King, and ever wills the highest.

Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.


`Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!

Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!

Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.


`The King will follow Christ, and we the King

In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.

Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.'


So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.

There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,

The slowly-fading mistress of the world,

Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.

But Arthur spake, `Behold, for these have sworn

To wage my wars, and worship me their King;

The old order changeth, yielding place to new;

And we that fight for our fair father Christ,

Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old

To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,

No tribute will we pay:' so those great lords

Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.


And Arthur and his knighthood for a space

Were all one will, and through that strength the King

Drew in the petty princedoms under him,

Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame

The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.

Poem 117: The Death of the Old Year

Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,

And the winter winds are wearily sighing:

Toll ye the church bell sad and slow,

And tread softly and speak low,

For the old year lies a-dying.

       Old year you must not die;

       You came to us so readily,

       You lived with us so steadily,

       Old year you shall not die.


He lieth still: he doth not move:

He will not see the dawn of day.

He hath no other life above.

He gave me a friend and a true truelove

And the New-year will take 'em away.

       Old year you must not go;

       So long you have been with us,

       Such joy as you have seen with us,

       Old year, you shall not go.


He froth'd his bumpers to the brim;

A jollier year we shall not see.

But tho' his eyes are waxing dim,

And tho' his foes speak ill of him,

He was a friend to me.

       Old year, you shall not die;

       We did so laugh and cry with you,

       I've half a mind to die with you,

       Old year, if you must die.


He was full of joke and jest,

But all his merry quips are o'er.

To see him die across the waste

His son and heir doth ride post-haste,

But he'll be dead before.

       Every one for his own.

       The night is starry and cold, my friend,

       And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,

       Comes up to take his own.


How hard he breathes! over the snow

I heard just now the crowing cock.

The shadows flicker to and fro:

The cricket chirps: the light burns low:

'Tis nearly twelve o'clock.

       Shake hands, before you die.

       Old year, we'll dearly rue for you:

       What is it we can do for you?

       Speak out before you die.


His face is growing sharp and thin.

Alack! our friend is gone,

Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:

Step from the corpse, and let him in

That standeth there alone,

       And waiteth at the door.

       There's a new foot on the floor, my friend,

       And a new face at the door, my friend,

       A new face at the door.

Poem 118: The Deserted House

Life and Thought have gone away

Side by side,

Leaving door and windows wide.

Careless tenants they!


All within is dark as night:

In the windows is no light;

And no murmur at the door,

So frequent on its hinge before.


Close the door; the shutters close;

Or through the windows we shall see

The nakedness and vacancy

Of the dark deserted house.


Come away: no more of mirth

Is here or merry-making sound.

The house was builded of the earth,

And shall fall again to ground.


Come away: for Life and Thought

Here no longer dwell;

But in a city glorious -

A great and distant city -have bought

A mansion incorruptible.

Would they could have stayed with us!

Poem 120: The Flower

Once in a golden hour

    I cast to earth a seed.

Up there came a flower,

    The people said, a weed.


To and fro they went

    Thro' my garden bower,

And muttering discontent

    Cursed me and my flower.


Then it grew so tall

    It wore a crown of light,

But thieves from o'er the wall

    Stole the seed by night.


Sow'd it far and wide

    By every town and tower,

Till all the people cried,

    "Splendid is the flower!"


Read my little fable:

    He that runs may read.

Most can raise the flowers now,

    For all have got the seed.


And some are pretty enough,

    And some are poor indeed;

And now again the people

    Call it but a weed.

Poem 121: The Grandmother

I.


And Willy, my eldest-born, is gone, you say, little Anne?

Ruddy and white, and strong on his legs, he looks like a man.

And Willy's wife has written: she never was over-wise,

Never the wife for Willy: he would n't take my advice.


II.


For, Annie, you see, her father was not the man to save,

Had n't a head to manage, and drank himself into his grave.

Pretty enough, very pretty! but I was against it for one.

Eh!--but he would n't hear me--and Willy, you say, is gone.



III.


Willy, my beauty, my eldest-born, the flower of the flock;

Never a man could fling him: for Willy stood like a rock.

`Here's a leg for a babe of a week!' says doctor; and he would be bound,

There was not his like that year in twenty parishes round.



IV.


Strong of his hands, and strong on his legs, but still of his tongue!

I ought to have gone before him: I wonder he went so young.

I cannot cry for him, Annie: I have not long to stay;

Perhaps I shall see him the sooner, for he lived far away.



V.


Why do you look at me, Annie? you think I am hard and cold;

But all my children have gone before me, I am so old:

I cannot weep for Willy, nor can I weep for the rest;

Only at your age, Annie, I could have wept with the best.



VI.


For I remember a quarrel I had with your father, my dear,

All for a slanderous story, that cost me many a tear.

I mean your grandfather, Annie: it cost me a world of woe,

Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years ago.



VII.


For Jenny, my cousin, had come to the place, and I knew right well

That Jenny had tript in her time: I knew, but I would not tell.

And she to be coming and slandering me, the base little liar!

But the tongue is a fire as you know, my dear, the tongue is a fire.



VIII.


And the parson made it his text that week, and he said likewise,

That a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies,

That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright,

But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight.


IX.


And Willy had not been down to the farm for a week and a day;

And all things look'd half-dead, tho' it was the middle of May.

Jenny, to slander me, who knew what Jenny had been!

But soiling another, Annie, will never make oneself clean.


X.


And I cried myself well-nigh blind, and all of an evening late

I climb'd to the top of the garth, and stood by the road at the gate.

The moon like a rick on fire was rising over the dale,

And whit, whit, whit, in the bush beside me chirrupt the nightingale.


XI.


All of a sudden he stopt: there past by the gate of the farm,

Willy,--he did n't see me,--and Jenny hung on his arm.

Out into the road I started, and spoke I scarce knew how;

Ah, there's no fool like the old one -- it makes me angry now.


XII.


Willy stood up like a man, and look'd the thing that he meant;

Jenny, the viper, made me a mocking courtesy and went.

And I said, `Let us part: in a hundred years it'll all be the same,

You cannot love me at all, if you love not my good name.'


XIII.


And he turn'd, and I saw his eyes all wet, in the sweet moonshine:

Sweetheart, I love you so well that your good name is mine.

And what do I care for Jane, let her speak of you well of ill;

But marry me out of hand: we two shall be happy still.'


XIV.


`Marry you, Willy!' said I, `but I needs must speak my mind,

And I fear you'll listen to tales, be jealous and hard and unkind.'

But he turn'd and claspt me in his arms, and answer'd, `No, love, no;'

Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years ago.


XV.


So Willy and I were wedded: I wore a lilac gown;

And the ringers rang with a will, and he gave the ringers a crown.

But the first that ever I bare was dead before he was born,

Shadow and shine is life, little Annie, flower and thorn.


XVI.


That was the first time, too, that ever I thought of death.

There lay the sweet little body that never had drawn a breath.

I had not wept, little Anne, not since I had been a wife;

But I wept like a child that day, for the babe had fought for his life.


XVII.


His dear little face was troubled, as if with anger or pain:

I look'd at the still little body--his trouble had all been in vain.

For Willy I cannot weep, I shall see him another morn:

But I wept like a child for the child that was dead before he was born.


XVIII.


But he cheer'd me, my good man, for he seldom said me nay:

Kind, like a man, was he; like a man, too, would have his way:

Never jealous--not he: we had many a happy year;

And he died, and I could not weep--my own time seem'd so near.


XIX.


But I wish'd it had been God's will that I, too, then could have died:

I began to be tired a little, and fain had slept at his side.

And that was ten years back, or more, if I don't forget:

But as to the children, Annie, they're all about me yet.


XX.


Pattering over the boards, my Annie who left me at two,

Patter she goes, my own little Annie, an Annie like you:

Pattering over the boards, she comes and goes at her will,

While Harry is in the five-acre and Charlie ploughing the hill.


XXI.


And Harry and Charlie, I hear them too--they sing to their team:

Often they come to the door in a pleasant kind of a dream.

They come and sit by my chair, they hover about my bed--

I am not always certain if they be alive or dead.


XXII.


And yet I know for a truth, there's none of them left alive;

For Harry went at sixty, your father at sixty- five:

And Willy, my eldest born, at nigh threescore and ten;

I knew them all as babies, and now they're elderly men.


XXIII.


For mine is a time of peace, it is not often I grieve;

I am oftener sitting at home in my father's farm at eve:

And the neighbors come and laugh and gossip, and so do I;

I find myself often laughing at things that have long gone by.


XXIV.


To be sure the preacher says, our sins should make us sad:

But mine is a time of peace, and there is Grace to be had;

And God, not man, is the Judge of us all when life shall cease;

And in this Book, little Annie, the message is one of Peace.


XXV.


And age is a time of peace, so it be free from pain,

And happy has been my life; but I would not live it again.

I seem to be tired a little, that's all, and long for rest;

Only at your age, Annie, I could have wept with the best.


XXVI.


So Willy has gone, my beauty, my eldest-born, my flower;

But how can I weep for Willy, he has but gone for an hour,--

Gone for a minute, my son, from this room into the next;

I, too, shall go in a minute.  What time have I to be vext?


XXVII.


And Willy's wife has written, she never was over-wise.

Get me my glasses, Annie: thank God that I keep my eyes.

There is but a trifle left you, when I shall have past away.

But stay with the old woman now: you cannot have long to stay.

Poem 122: The Higher Pantheism

The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains,-

Are not these, O Soul, the Vision of Him who reigns?

Is not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems?

Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?

Earth, these solid stars, this weight of body and limb,

Are they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him?

Dark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why,

For is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel "I am I"?

Glory about thee, without thee; and thou fulfillest thy doom,

Making Him broken gleams and a stifled splendour and gloom.


Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet-

Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.


God is law, say the wise; O soul, and let us rejoice,

For if He thunder by law the thunder is yet His voice.


Law is God, say some; no God at all, says the fool,

For all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool;


And the ear of man cannot hear, and the eye of man cannot see;

But if we could see and hear, this Vision-were it not He?

Poem 123: The Holy Grail

From noiseful arms, and acts of prowess done

In tournament or tilt, Sir Percivale,

Whom Arthur and his knighthood called The Pure,

Had passed into the silent life of prayer,

Praise, fast, and alms; and leaving for the cowl

The helmet in an abbey far away

From Camelot, there, and not long after, died.


And one, a fellow-monk among the rest,

Ambrosius, loved him much beyond the rest,

And honoured him, and wrought into his heart

A way by love that wakened love within,

To answer that which came:  and as they sat

Beneath a world-old yew-tree, darkening half

The cloisters, on a gustful April morn

That puffed the swaying branches into smoke

Above them, ere the summer when he died

The monk Ambrosius questioned Percivale:


`O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,

Spring after spring, for half a hundred years:

For never have I known the world without,

Nor ever strayed beyond the pale:  but thee,

When first thou camest--such a courtesy

Spake through the limbs and in the voice--I knew

For one of those who eat in Arthur's hall;

For good ye are and bad, and like to coins,

Some true, some light, but every one of you

Stamped with the image of the King; and now

Tell me, what drove thee from the Table Round,

My brother? was it earthly passion crost?'


`Nay,' said the knight; `for no such passion mine.

But the sweet vision of the Holy Grail

Drove me from all vainglories, rivalries,

And earthly heats that spring and sparkle out

Among us in the jousts, while women watch

Who wins, who falls; and waste the spiritual strength

Within us, better offered up to Heaven.'


To whom the monk:  `The Holy Grail!--I trust

We are green in Heaven's eyes; but here too much

We moulder--as to things without I mean--

Yet one of your own knights, a guest of ours,

Told us of this in our refectory,

But spake with such a sadness and so low

We heard not half of what he said.  What is it?

The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?'


`Nay, monk! what phantom?' answered Percivale.

`The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord

Drank at the last sad supper with his own.

This, from the blessd land of Aromat--

After the day of darkness, when the dead

Went wandering o'er Moriah--the good saint

Arimathan Joseph, journeying brought

To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn

Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.

And there awhile it bode; and if a man

Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,

By faith, of all his ills.  But then the times

Grew to such evil that the holy cup

Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared.'


To whom the monk:  `From our old books I know

That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,

And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,

Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;

And there he built with wattles from the marsh

A little lonely church in days of yore,

For so they say, these books of ours, but seem

Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.

But who first saw the holy thing today?'


`A woman,' answered Percivale, `a nun,

And one no further off in blood from me

Than sister; and if ever holy maid

With knees of adoration wore the stone,

A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,

But that was in her earlier maidenhood,

With such a fervent flame of human love,

Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot

Only to holy things; to prayer and praise

She gave herself, to fast and alms.  And yet,

Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,

Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,

And the strange sound of an adulterous race,

Across the iron grating of her cell

Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.


`And he to whom she told her sins, or what

Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,

A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,

Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,

A legend handed down through five or six,

And each of these a hundred winters old,

From our Lord's time.  And when King Arthur made

His Table Round, and all men's hearts became

Clean for a season, surely he had thought

That now the Holy Grail would come again;

But sin broke out.  Ah, Christ, that it would come,

And heal the world of all their wickedness!

"O Father!" asked the maiden, "might it come

To me by prayer and fasting?"  "Nay," said he,

"I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow."

And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun

Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought

She might have risen and floated when I saw her.


`For on a day she sent to speak with me.

And when she came to speak, behold her eyes

Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,

Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,

Beautiful in the light of holiness.

And "O my brother Percivale," she said,

"Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:

For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound

As of a silver horn from o'er the hills

Blown, and I thought, `It is not Arthur's use

To hunt by moonlight;' and the slender sound

As from a distance beyond distance grew

Coming upon me--O never harp nor horn,

Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,

Was like that music as it came; and then

Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,

And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,

Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,

Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed

With rosy colours leaping on the wall;

And then the music faded, and the Grail

Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls

The rosy quiverings died into the night.

So now the Holy Thing is here again

Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,

And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,

That so perchance the vision may be seen

By thee and those, and all the world be healed."


`Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this

To all men; and myself fasted and prayed

Always, and many among us many a week

Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,

Expectant of the wonder that would be.


`And one there was among us, ever moved

Among us in white armour, Galahad.

"God make thee good as thou art beautiful,"

Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,

In so young youth, was ever made a knight

Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard

My sister's vision, filled me with amaze;

His eyes became so like her own, they seemed

Hers, and himself her brother more than I.


`Sister or brother none had he; but some

Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said

Begotten by enchantment--chatterers they,

Like birds of passage piping up and down,

That gape for flies--we know not whence they come;

For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?


`But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away

Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair

Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;

And out of this she plaited broad and long

A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread

And crimson in the belt a strange device,

A crimson grail within a silver beam;

And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,

Saying, "My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,

O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,

I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.

Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,

And break through all, till one will crown thee king

Far in the spiritual city:" and as she spake

She sent the deathless passion in her eyes

Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind

On him, and he believed in her belief.


`Then came a year of miracle:  O brother,

In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,

Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,

And carven with strange figures; and in and out

The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll

Of letters in a tongue no man could read.

And Merlin called it "The Siege perilous,"

Perilous for good and ill; "for there," he said,

"No man could sit but he should lose himself:"

And once by misadvertence Merlin sat

In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,

Galahad, when he heard of Merlin's doom,

Cried, "If I lose myself, I save myself!"


`Then on a summer night it came to pass,

While the great banquet lay along the hall,

That Galahad would sit down in Merlin's chair.


`And all at once, as there we sat, we heard

A cracking and a riving of the roofs,

And rending, and a blast, and overhead

Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.

And in the blast there smote along the hall

A beam of light seven times more clear than day:

And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail

All over covered with a luminous cloud.

And none might see who bare it, and it past.

But every knight beheld his fellow's face

As in a glory, and all the knights arose,

And staring each at other like dumb men

Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.


`I sware a vow before them all, that I,

Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride

A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,

Until I found and saw it, as the nun

My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,

And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot's cousin, sware,

And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,

And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest.'


Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,

`What said the King?  Did Arthur take the vow?'


`Nay, for my lord,' said Percivale, `the King,

Was not in hall:  for early that same day,

Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,

An outraged maiden sprang into the hall

Crying on help:  for all her shining hair

Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm

Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore

Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn

In tempest:  so the King arose and went

To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees

That made such honey in his realm.  Howbeit

Some little of this marvel he too saw,

Returning o'er the plain that then began

To darken under Camelot; whence the King

Looked up, calling aloud, "Lo, there! the roofs

Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!

Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt."

For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,

As having there so oft with all his knights

Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.


`O brother, had you known our mighty hall,

Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!

For all the sacred mount of Camelot,

And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,

Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,

By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,

Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.

And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt

With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:

And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,

And in the second men are slaying beasts,

And on the third are warriors, perfect men,

And on the fourth are men with growing wings,

And over all one statue in the mould

Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,

And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.

And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown

And both the wings are made of gold, and flame

At sunrise till the people in far fields,

Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,

Behold it, crying, "We have still a King."


`And, brother, had you known our hall within,

Broader and higher than any in all the lands!

Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur's wars,

And all the light that falls upon the board

Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.

Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,

Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,

Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.

And also one to the west, and counter to it,

And blank:  and who shall blazon it? when and how?--

O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,

The brand Excalibur will be cast away.


`So to this hall full quickly rode the King,

In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,

Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt

In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.

And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw

The golden dragon sparkling over all:

And many of those who burnt the hold, their arms

Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,

Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,

Full of the vision, prest:  and then the King

Spake to me, being nearest, "Percivale,"

(Because the hall was all in tumult--some

Vowing, and some protesting), "what is this?"


`O brother, when I told him what had chanced,

My sister's vision, and the rest, his face

Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,

When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,

Darken; and "Woe is me, my knights," he cried,

"Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow."

Bold was mine answer, "Had thyself been here,

My King, thou wouldst have sworn."  "Yea, yea," said he,

"Art thou so bold and hast not seen the Grail?"


`"Nay, lord, I heard the sound, I saw the light,

But since I did not see the Holy Thing,

I sware a vow to follow it till I saw."


`Then when he asked us, knight by knight, if any

Had seen it, all their answers were as one:

"Nay, lord, and therefore have we sworn our vows."


`"Lo now," said Arthur, "have ye seen a cloud?

What go ye into the wilderness to see?"


`Then Galahad on the sudden, and in a voice

Shrilling along the hall to Arthur, called,

"But I, Sir Arthur, saw the Holy Grail,

I saw the Holy Grail and heard a cry--

`O Galahad, and O Galahad, follow me.'"


`"Ah, Galahad, Galahad," said the King, "for such

As thou art is the vision, not for these.

Thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign--

Holier is none, my Percivale, than she--

A sign to maim this Order which I made.

But ye, that follow but the leader's bell"

(Brother, the King was hard upon his knights)

"Taliessin is our fullest throat of song,

And one hath sung and all the dumb will sing.

Lancelot is Lancelot, and hath overborne

Five knights at once, and every younger knight,

Unproven, holds himself as Lancelot,

Till overborne by one, he learns--and ye,

What are ye? Galahads?--no, nor Percivales"

(For thus it pleased the King to range me close

After Sir Galahad); "nay," said he, "but men

With strength and will to right the wronged, of power

To lay the sudden heads of violence flat,

Knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed

The strong White Horse in his own heathen blood--

But one hath seen, and all the blind will see.

Go, since your vows are sacred, being made:

Yet--for ye know the cries of all my realm

Pass through this hall--how often, O my knights,

Your places being vacant at my side,

This chance of noble deeds will come and go

Unchallenged, while ye follow wandering fires

Lost in the quagmire!  Many of you, yea most,

Return no more:  ye think I show myself

Too dark a prophet:  come now, let us meet

The morrow morn once more in one full field

Of gracious pastime, that once more the King,

Before ye leave him for this Quest, may count

The yet-unbroken strength of all his knights,

Rejoicing in that Order which he made."


`So when the sun broke next from under ground,

All the great table of our Arthur closed

And clashed in such a tourney and so full,

So many lances broken--never yet

Had Camelot seen the like, since Arthur came;

And I myself and Galahad, for a strength

Was in us from this vision, overthrew

So many knights that all the people cried,

And almost burst the barriers in their heat,

Shouting, "Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!"


`But when the next day brake from under ground--

O brother, had you known our Camelot,

Built by old kings, age after age, so old

The King himself had fears that it would fall,

So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs

Tottered toward each other in the sky,

Met foreheads all along the street of those

Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long

Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks

Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,

Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers

Fell as we past; and men and boys astride

On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,

At all the corners, named us each by name,

Calling, "God speed!" but in the ways below

The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor

Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak

For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,

Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,

"This madness has come on us for our sins."

So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,

Where Arthur's wars are rendered mystically,

And thence departed every one his way.


`And I was lifted up in heart, and thought

Of all my late-shown prowess in the lists,

How my strong lance had beaten down the knights,

So many and famous names; and never yet

Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,

For all my blood danced in me, and I knew

That I should light upon the Holy Grail.


`Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,

That most of us would follow wandering fires,

Came like a driving gloom across my mind.

Then every evil word I had spoken once,

And every evil thought I had thought of old,

And every evil deed I ever did,

Awoke and cried, "This Quest is not for thee."

And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself

Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,

And I was thirsty even unto death;

And I, too, cried, "This Quest is not for thee."


`And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst

Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,

With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white

Played ever back upon the sloping wave,

And took both ear and eye; and o'er the brook

Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook

Fallen, and on the lawns.  "I will rest here,"

I said, "I am not worthy of the Quest;"

But even while I drank the brook, and ate

The goodly apples, all these things at once

Fell into dust, and I was left alone,

And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.


`And then behold a woman at a door

Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,

And kind the woman's eyes and innocent,

And all her bearing gracious; and she rose

Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,

"Rest here;" but when I touched her, lo! she, too,

Fell into dust and nothing, and the house

Became no better than a broken shed,

And in it a dead babe; and also this

Fell into dust, and I was left alone.


`And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.

Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,

And where it smote the plowshare in the field,

The plowman left his plowing, and fell down

Before it; where it glittered on her pail,

The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down

Before it, and I knew not why, but thought

"The sun is rising," though the sun had risen.

Then was I ware of one that on me moved

In golden armour with a crown of gold

About a casque all jewels; and his horse

In golden armour jewelled everywhere:

And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;

And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,

Being so huge.  But when I thought he meant

To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,

Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,

And up I went and touched him, and he, too,

Fell into dust, and I was left alone

And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.


`And I rode on and found a mighty hill,

And on the top, a city walled:  the spires

Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.

And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these

Cried to me climbing, "Welcome, Percivale!

Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!"

And glad was I and clomb, but found at top

No man, nor any voice.  And thence I past

Far through a ruinous city, and I saw

That man had once dwelt there; but there I found

Only one man of an exceeding age.

"Where is that goodly company," said I,

"That so cried out upon me?" and he had

Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,

"Whence and what art thou?" and even as he spoke

Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I

Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,

"Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself

And touch it, it will crumble into dust."


`And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,

Low as the hill was high, and where the vale

Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby

A holy hermit in a hermitage,

To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:


`"O son, thou hast not true humility,

The highest virtue, mother of them all;

For when the Lord of all things made Himself

Naked of glory for His mortal change,

`Take thou my robe,' she said, `for all is thine,'

And all her form shone forth with sudden light

So that the angels were amazed, and she

Followed Him down, and like a flying star

Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;

But her thou hast not known:  for what is this

Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?

Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself

As Galahad."  When the hermit made an end,

In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone

Before us, and against the chapel door

Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.

And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,

And at the sacring of the mass I saw

The holy elements alone; but he,

"Saw ye no more?  I, Galahad, saw the Grail,

The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:

I saw the fiery face as of a child

That smote itself into the bread, and went;

And hither am I come; and never yet

Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,

This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come

Covered, but moving with me night and day,

Fainter by day, but always in the night

Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh

Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top

Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below

Blood-red.  And in the strength of this I rode,

Shattering all evil customs everywhere,

And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,

And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,

And broke through all, and in the strength of this

Come victor.  But my time is hard at hand,

And hence I go; and one will crown me king

Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,

For thou shalt see the vision when I go."


`While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,

Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew

One with him, to believe as he believed.

Then, when the day began to wane, we went.


`There rose a hill that none but man could climb,

Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses--

Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm

Round us and death; for every moment glanced

His silver arms and gloomed:  so quick and thick

The lightnings here and there to left and right

Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,

Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,

Sprang into fire:  and at the base we found

On either hand, as far as eye could see,

A great black swamp and of an evil smell,

Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,

Not to be crost, save that some ancient king

Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,

A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.

And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,

And every bridge as quickly as he crost

Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned

To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens

Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed

Shoutings of all the sons of God:  and first

At once I saw him far on the great Sea,

In silver-shining armour starry-clear;

And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung

Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.

And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,

If boat it were--I saw not whence it came.

And when the heavens opened and blazed again

Roaring, I saw him like a silver star--

And had he set the sail, or had the boat

Become a living creature clad with wings?

And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung

Redder than any rose, a joy to me,

For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.

Then in a moment when they blazed again

Opening, I saw the least of little stars

Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star

I saw the spiritual city and all her spires

And gateways in a glory like one pearl--

No larger, though the goal of all the saints--

Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot

A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there

Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,

Which never eyes on earth again shall see.

Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.

And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge

No memory in me lives; but that I touched

The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence

Taking my war-horse from the holy man,

Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned

To whence I came, the gate of Arthur's wars.'


`O brother,' asked Ambrosius,--`for in sooth

These ancient books--and they would win thee--teem,

Only I find not there this Holy Grail,

With miracles and marvels like to these,

Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,

Who read but on my breviary with ease,

Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass

Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,

And almost plastered like a martin's nest

To these old walls--and mingle with our folk;

And knowing every honest face of theirs

As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,

And every homely secret in their hearts,

Delight myself with gossip and old wives,

And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,

And mirthful sayings, children of the place,

That have no meaning half a league away:

Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,

Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,

Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,

Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs--

O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,

Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,

No man, no woman?'


                 Then Sir Percivale:

`All men, to one so bound by such a vow,

And women were as phantoms.  O, my brother,

Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee

How far I faltered from my quest and vow?

For after I had lain so many nights

A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,

In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan

And meagre, and the vision had not come;

And then I chanced upon a goodly town

With one great dwelling in the middle of it;

Thither I made, and there was I disarmed

By maidens each as fair as any flower:

But when they led me into hall, behold,

The Princess of that castle was the one,

Brother, and that one only, who had ever

Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old

A slender page about her father's hall,

And she a slender maiden, all my heart

Went after her with longing:  yet we twain

Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.

And now I came upon her once again,

And one had wedded her, and he was dead,

And all his land and wealth and state were hers.

And while I tarried, every day she set

A banquet richer than the day before

By me; for all her longing and her will

Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,

I walking to and fro beside a stream

That flashed across her orchard underneath

Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,

And calling me the greatest of all knights,

Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,

And gave herself and all her wealth to me.

Then I remembered Arthur's warning word,

That most of us would follow wandering fires,

And the Quest faded in my heart.  Anon,

The heads of all her people drew to me,

With supplication both of knees and tongue:

"We have heard of thee:  thou art our greatest knight,

Our Lady says it, and we well believe:

Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,

And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land."

O me, my brother! but one night my vow

Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,

But wailed and wept, and hated mine own self,

And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;

Then after I was joined with Galahad

Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth.'


Then said the monk, `Poor men, when yule is cold,

Must be content to sit by little fires.

And this am I, so that ye care for me

Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven

That brought thee here to this poor house of ours

Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm

My cold heart with a friend:  but O the pity

To find thine own first love once more--to hold,

Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,

Or all but hold, and then--cast her aside,

Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.

For we that want the warmth of double life,

We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet

Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich,--

Ah, blessd Lord, I speak too earthlywise,

Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,

But live like an old badger in his earth,

With earth about him everywhere, despite

All fast and penance.  Saw ye none beside,

None of your knights?'


                     `Yea so,' said Percivale:

`One night my pathway swerving east, I saw

The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors

All in the middle of the rising moon:

And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,

And each made joy of either; then he asked,

"Where is he? hast thou seen him--Lancelot?--Once,"

Said good Sir Bors, "he dashed across me--mad,

And maddening what he rode:  and when I cried,

`Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest

So holy,' Lancelot shouted, `Stay me not!

I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,

For now there is a lion in the way.'

So vanished."


            `Then Sir Bors had ridden on

Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,

Because his former madness, once the talk

And scandal of our table, had returned;

For Lancelot's kith and kin so worship him

That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors

Beyond the rest:  he well had been content

Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,

The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,

Being so clouded with his grief and love,

Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:

If God would send the vision, well:  if not,

The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.


`And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors

Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,

And found a people there among their crags,

Our race and blood, a remnant that were left

Paynim amid their circles, and the stones

They pitch up straight to heaven:  and their wise men

Were strong in that old magic which can trace

The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him

And this high Quest as at a simple thing:

Told him he followed--almost Arthur's words--

A mocking fire:  "what other fire than he,

Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,

And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?"

And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,

Hearing he had a difference with their priests,

Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell

Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there

In darkness through innumerable hours

He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep

Over him till by miracle--what else?--

Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,

Such as no wind could move:  and through the gap

Glimmered the streaming scud:  then came a night

Still as the day was loud; and through the gap

The seven clear stars of Arthur's Table Round--

For, brother, so one night, because they roll

Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,

Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King--

And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,

In on him shone:  "And then to me, to me,"

Said good Sir Bors, "beyond all hopes of mine,

Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself--

Across the seven clear stars--O grace to me--

In colour like the fingers of a hand

Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail

Glided and past, and close upon it pealed

A sharp quick thunder."  Afterwards, a maid,

Who kept our holy faith among her kin

In secret, entering, loosed and let him go.'


To whom the monk:  `And I remember now

That pelican on the casque:  Sir Bors it was

Who spake so low and sadly at our board;

And mighty reverent at our grace was he:

A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,

An out-door sign of all the warmth within,

Smiled with his lips--a smile beneath a cloud,

But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:

Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else?  But when ye reached

The city, found ye all your knights returned,

Or was there sooth in Arthur's prophecy,

Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?'


Then answered Percivale:  `And that can I,

Brother, and truly; since the living words

Of so great men as Lancelot and our King

Pass not from door to door and out again,

But sit within the house.  O, when we reached

The city, our horses stumbling as they trode

On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,

Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,

And shattered talbots, which had left the stones

Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.


`And there sat Arthur on the das-throne,

And those that had gone out upon the Quest,

Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,

And those that had not, stood before the King,

Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,

Saying, "A welfare in thine eye reproves

Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee

On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.

So fierce a gale made havoc here of late

Among the strange devices of our kings;

Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,

And from the statue Merlin moulded for us

Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now--the Quest,

This vision--hast thou seen the Holy Cup,

That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?"


`So when I told him all thyself hast heard,

Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve

To pass away into the quiet life,

He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked

Of Gawain, "Gawain, was this Quest for thee?"


`"Nay, lord," said Gawain, "not for such as I.

Therefore I communed with a saintly man,

Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;

For I was much awearied of the Quest:

But found a silk pavilion in a field,

And merry maidens in it; and then this gale

Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,

And blew my merry maidens all about

With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,

My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me."


`He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first

He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed

Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,

Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,

Until the King espied him, saying to him,

"Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true

Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;" and Bors,

"Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:

I saw it;" and the tears were in his eyes.


`Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest

Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;

Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,

Our Arthur kept his best until the last;

"Thou, too, my Lancelot," asked the king, "my friend,

Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?"


`"Our mightiest!" answered Lancelot, with a groan;

"O King!"--and when he paused, methought I spied

A dying fire of madness in his eyes--

"O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,

Happier are those that welter in their sin,

Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime,

Slime of the ditch:  but in me lived a sin

So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,

Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung

Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower

And poisonous grew together, each as each,

Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights

Sware, I sware with them only in the hope

That could I touch or see the Holy Grail

They might be plucked asunder.  Then I spake

To one most holy saint, who wept and said,

That save they could be plucked asunder, all

My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed

That I would work according as he willed.

And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove

To tear the twain asunder in my heart,

My madness came upon me as of old,

And whipt me into waste fields far away;

There was I beaten down by little men,

Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword

And shadow of my spear had been enow

To scare them from me once; and then I came

All in my folly to the naked shore,

Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;

But such a blast, my King, began to blow,

So loud a blast along the shore and sea,

Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,

Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea

Drove like a cataract, and all the sand

Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens

Were shaken with the motion and the sound.

And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,

Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;

And in my madness to myself I said,

`I will embark and I will lose myself,

And in the great sea wash away my sin.'

I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.

Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,

And with me drove the moon and all the stars;

And the wind fell, and on the seventh night

I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,

And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,

Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,

A castle like a rock upon a rock,

With chasm-like portals open to the sea,

And steps that met the breaker! there was none

Stood near it but a lion on each side

That kept the entry, and the moon was full.

Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.

There drew my sword.  With sudden-flaring manes

Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,

Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;

And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,

`Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts

Will tear thee piecemeal.'  Then with violence

The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.

And up into the sounding hall I past;

But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,

No bench nor table, painting on the wall

Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon

Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.

But always in the quiet house I heard,

Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark,

A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower

To the eastward:  up I climbed a thousand steps

With pain:  as in a dream I seemed to climb

For ever:  at the last I reached a door,

A light was in the crannies, and I heard,

`Glory and joy and honour to our Lord

And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.'

Then in my madness I essayed the door;

It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat

As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,

Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,

With such a fierceness that I swooned away--

O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,

All palled in crimson samite, and around

Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.

And but for all my madness and my sin,

And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw

That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled

And covered; and this Quest was not for me."


`So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left

The hall long silent, till Sir Gawain--nay,

Brother, I need not tell thee foolish words,--

A reckless and irreverent knight was he,

Now boldened by the silence of his King,--

Well, I will tell thee:  "O King, my liege," he said,

"Hath Gawain failed in any quest of thine?

When have I stinted stroke in foughten field?

But as for thine, my good friend Percivale,

Thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad,

Yea, made our mightiest madder than our least.

But by mine eyes and by mine ears I swear,

I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,

And thrice as blind as any noonday owl,

To holy virgins in their ecstasies,

Henceforward."


             `"Deafer," said the blameless King,

"Gawain, and blinder unto holy things

Hope not to make thyself by idle vows,

Being too blind to have desire to see.

But if indeed there came a sign from heaven,

Blessd are Bors, Lancelot and Percivale,

For these have seen according to their sight.

For every fiery prophet in old times,

And all the sacred madness of the bard,

When God made music through them, could but speak

His music by the framework and the chord;

And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth.


`"Nay--but thou errest, Lancelot:  never yet

Could all of true and noble in knight and man

Twine round one sin, whatever it might be,

With such a closeness, but apart there grew,

Save that he were the swine thou spakest of,

Some root of knighthood and pure nobleness;

Whereto see thou, that it may bear its flower.


`"And spake I not too truly, O my knights?

Was I too dark a prophet when I said

To those who went upon the Holy Quest,

That most of them would follow wandering fires,

Lost in the quagmire?--lost to me and gone,

And left me gazing at a barren board,

And a lean Order--scarce returned a tithe--

And out of those to whom the vision came

My greatest hardly will believe he saw;

Another hath beheld it afar off,

And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,

Cares but to pass into the silent life.

And one hath had the vision face to face,

And now his chair desires him here in vain,

However they may crown him otherwhere.


`"And some among you held, that if the King

Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:

Not easily, seeing that the King must guard

That which he rules, and is but as the hind

To whom a space of land is given to plow.

Who may not wander from the allotted field

Before his work be done; but, being done,

Let visions of the night or of the day

Come, as they will; and many a time they come,

Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,

This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,

This air that smites his forehead is not air

But vision--yea, his very hand and foot--

In moments when he feels he cannot die,

And knows himself no vision to himself,

Nor the high God a vision, nor that One

Who rose again:  ye have seen what ye have seen."


`So spake the King:  I knew not all he meant.'

Poem 124: The Kraken

Below the thunders of the upper deep,

Far far beneath in the abysmal sea,

His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep

The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee

About his shadowy sides: above him swell

Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;

And far away into the sickly light,

From many a wondrous grot and secret cell

Unnumbered and enormous polypi

Winnow with giant fins the slumbering green.

There hath he lain for ages and will lie

Battering upon huge seaworms in his sleep,

Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;

Then once by men and angels to be seen,

In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.

Poem 125: The Lady of Shalott

PART I



On either side the river lie

Long fields of barley and of rye,

That clothe the wold and meet the sky;

And thro' the field the road runs by

To many-tower'd Camelot;

And up and down the people go,

Gazing where the lilies blow

Round an island there below,

The island of Shalott.


Willows whiten, aspens quiver,

Little breezes dusk and shiver

Thro' the wave that runs for ever

By the island in the river

Flowing down to Camelot.

Four gray walls, and four gray towers,

Overlook a space of flowers,

And the silent isle imbowers

The Lady of Shalott.


By the margin, willow-veil'd,

Slide the heavy barges trail'd

By slow horses; and unhail'd

The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd

Skimming down to Camelot:

But who hath seen her wave her hand?

Or at the casement seen her stand?

Or is she known in all the land,

The Lady of Shalott?


Only reapers, reaping early

In among the bearded barley,

Hear a song that echoes cheerly

From the river winding clearly,

Down to tower'd Camelot:

And by the moon the reaper weary,

Piling sheaves in uplands airy,

Listening, whispers ''Tis the fairy

Lady of Shalott.'


PART II



There she weaves by night and day

A magic web with colours gay.

She has heard a whisper say,

A curse is on her if she stay

To look down to Camelot.

She knows not what the curse may be,

And so she weaveth steadily,

And little other care hath she,

The Lady of Shalott.


And moving thro' a mirror clear

That hangs before her all the year,

Shadows of the world appear.

There she sees the highway near

Winding down to Camelot:

There the river eddy whirls,

And there the surly village-churls,

And the red cloaks of market girls,

Pass onward from Shalott.


Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,

An abbot on an ambling pad,

Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,

Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,

Goes by to tower'd Camelot;

And sometimes thro' the mirror blue

The knights come riding two and two:

She hath no loyal knight and true,

The Lady of Shalott.


But in her web she still delights

To weave the mirror's magic sights,

For often thro' the silent nights

A funeral, with plumes and lights,

And music, went to Camelot:

Or when the moon was overhead,

Came two young lovers lately wed;

'I am half sick of shadows,' said

The Lady of Shalott.


PART III



A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,

He rode between the barley-sheaves,

The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,

And flamed upon the brazen greaves

Of bold Sir Lancelot.

A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd

To a lady in his shield,

That sparkled on the yellow field,

Beside remote Shalott.


The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,

Like to some branch of stars we see

Hung in the golden Galaxy.

The bridle bells rang merrily

As he rode down to Camelot:

And from his blazon'd baldric slung

A mighty silver bugle hung,

And as he rode his armour rung,

Beside remote Shalott.


All in the blue unclouded weather

Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,

The helmet and the helmet-feather

Burn'd like one burning flame together,

As he rode down to Camelot.

As often thro' the purple night,

Below the starry clusters bright,

Some bearded meteor, trailing light,

Moves over still Shalott.


His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;

On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;

From underneath his helmet flow'd

His coal-black curls as on he rode,

As he rode down to Camelot.

From the bank and from the river

He flash'd into the crystal mirror,

'Tirra lirra,' by the river

Sang Sir Lancelot.


She left the web, she left the loom,

She made three paces thro' the room,

She saw the water-lily bloom,

She saw the helmet and the plume,

She look'd down to Camelot.

Out flew the web and floated wide;

The mirror crack'd from side to side;

'The curse is come upon me!' cried

The Lady of Shalott.


PART IV



In the stormy east-wind straining,

The pale yellow woods were waning,

The broad stream in his banks complaining,

Heavily the low sky raining

Over tower'd Camelot;


Down she came and found a boat

Beneath a willow left afloat,

And round about the prow she wrote

The Lady of Shalott.


And down the river's dim expanse—

Like some bold seer in a trance,

Seeing all his own mischance—

With a glassy countenance

Did she look to Camelot.

And at the closing of the day

She loosed the chain, and down she lay;

The broad stream bore her far away,

The Lady of Shalott.


Lying, robed in snowy white

That loosely flew to left and right—

The leaves upon her falling light—

Thro' the noises of the night

She floated down to Camelot:

And as the boat-head wound along

The willowy hills and fields among,

They heard her singing her last song,

The Lady of Shalott.


Heard a carol, mournful, holy,

Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,

Till her blood was frozen slowly,

And her eyes were darken'd wholly,

Turn'd to tower'd Camelot;

For ere she reach'd upon the tide

The first house by the water-side,

Singing in her song she died,

The Lady of Shalott.


Under tower and balcony,

By garden-wall and gallery,

A gleaming shape she floated by,

Dead-pale between the houses high,

Silent into Camelot.

Out upon the wharfs they came,

Knight and burgher, lord and dame,

And round the prow they read her name,

The Lady of Shalott.


Who is this? and what is here?

And in the lighted palace near

Died the sound of royal cheer;

And they cross'd themselves for fear,

All the knights at Camelot:

But Lancelot mused a little space;

He said, 'She has a lovely face;

God in His mercy lend her grace,

The Lady of Shalott.'

Poem 126: The Last Tournament

Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood

Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,

At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,

Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.

And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,

And from the crown thereof a carcanet

Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize

Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,

Came Tristram, saying, `Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'


For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once

Far down beneath a winding wall of rock

Heard a child wail.  A stump of oak half-dead,

From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,

Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air

Bearing an eagle's nest:  and through the tree

Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind

Pierced ever a child's cry:  and crag and tree

Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,

This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,

And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought

A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,

Then gave it to his Queen to rear:  the Queen

But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms

Received, and after loved it tenderly,

And named it Nestling; so forgot herself

A moment, and her cares; till that young life

Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold

Past from her; and in time the carcanet

Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:

So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,

`Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,

And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.'


To whom the King, `Peace to thine eagle-borne

Dead nestling, and this honour after death,

Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse

Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone

Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,

And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.'


`Would rather you had let them fall,' she cried,

`Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,

A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,

Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--

Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out

Above the river--that unhappy child

Past in her barge:  but rosier luck will go

With these rich jewels, seeing that they came

Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,

But the sweet body of a maiden babe.

Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights

May win them for the purest of my maids.'


She ended, and the cry of a great jousts

With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways

From Camelot in among the faded fields

To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights

Armed for a day of glory before the King.


But on the hither side of that loud morn

Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed

From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose

Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,

And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,

A churl, to whom indignantly the King,


`My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast

Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?

Man was it who marred heaven's image in thee thus?'


Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,

Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump

Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,


`He took them and he drave them to his tower--

Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--

A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--

Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight

Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;

And when I called upon thy name as one

That doest right by gentle and by churl,

Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,

Save that he sware me to a message, saying,

"Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I

Have founded my Round Table in the North,

And whatsoever his own knights have sworn

My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say

My tower is full of harlots, like his court,

But mine are worthier, seeing they profess

To be none other than themselves--and say

My knights are all adulterers like his own,

But mine are truer, seeing they profess

To be none other; and say his hour is come,

The heathen are upon him, his long lance

Broken, and his Excalibur a straw."'


Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,

`Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously

Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.

The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,

Hurled back again so often in empty foam,

Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,

Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom

The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,

Friends, through your manhood and your fealty,--now

Make their last head like Satan in the North.

My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower

Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,

Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,

The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.

But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place

Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;

For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,

Only to yield my Queen her own again?

Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent:  is it well?'


Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, `It is well:

Yet better if the King abide, and leave

The leading of his younger knights to me.

Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.'


Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,

And while they stood without the doors, the King

Turned to him saying, `Is it then so well?

Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he

Of whom was written, "A sound is in his ears"?

The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance

That only seems half-loyal to command,--

A manner somewhat fallen from reverence--

Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights

Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?

Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,

By noble deeds at one with noble vows,

From flat confusion and brute violences,

Reel back into the beast, and be no more?'


He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,

Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned

North by the gate.  In her high bower the Queen,

Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,

Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.

Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme

Of bygone Merlin, `Where is he who knows?

From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'


But when the morning of a tournament,

By these in earnest those in mockery called

The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,

Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,

Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,

The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,

And down a streetway hung with folds of pure

White samite, and by fountains running wine,

Where children sat in white with cups of gold,

Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps

Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.


He glanced and saw the stately galleries,

Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen

White-robed in honour of the stainless child,

And some with scattered jewels, like a bank

Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.

He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.


The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream

To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll

Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:

And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf

And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume

Went down it.  Sighing weariedly, as one

Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,

When all the goodlier guests are past away,

Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.

He saw the laws that ruled the tournament

Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down

Before his throne of arbitration cursed

The dead babe and the follies of the King;

And once the laces of a helmet cracked,

And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,

Modred, a narrow face:  anon he heard

The voice that billowed round the barriers roar

An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,

But newly-entered, taller than the rest,

And armoured all in forest green, whereon

There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,

And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,

With ever-scattering berries, and on shield

A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late

From overseas in Brittany returned,

And marriage with a princess of that realm,

Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--

Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain

His own against him, and now yearned to shake

The burthen off his heart in one full shock

With Tristram even to death:  his strong hands gript

And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,

Until he groaned for wrath--so many of those,

That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,

Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,

And there with gibes and flickering mockeries

Stood, while he muttered, `Craven crests!  O shame!

What faith have these in whom they sware to love?

The glory of our Round Table is no more.'


So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,

Not speaking other word than `Hast thou won?

Art thou the purest, brother?  See, the hand

Wherewith thou takest this, is red!' to whom

Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,

Made answer, `Ay, but wherefore toss me this

Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?

Lest be thy fair Queen's fantasy.  Strength of heart

And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,

Are winners in this pastime of our King.

My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--

No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,

Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,

Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;

Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.'


And Tristram round the gallery made his horse

Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,

`Fair damsels, each to him who worships each

Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold

This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.'

And most of these were mute, some angered, one

Murmuring, `All courtesy is dead,' and one,

`The glory of our Round Table is no more.'


Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,

And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day

Went glooming down in wet and weariness:

But under her black brows a swarthy one

Laughed shrilly, crying, `Praise the patient saints,

Our one white day of Innocence hath past,

Though somewhat draggled at the skirt.  So be it.

The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,

Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.

Come--let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's

And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity

With all the kindlier colours of the field.'


So dame and damsel glittered at the feast

Variously gay:  for he that tells the tale

Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold

Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,

And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers

Pass under white, till the warm hour returns

With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;

So dame and damsel cast the simple white,

And glowing in all colours, the live grass,

Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced

About the revels, and with mirth so loud

Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,

And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,

Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower

Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.


And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,

High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,

Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.

Then Tristram saying, `Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'

Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,

`Belike for lack of wiser company;

Or being fool, and seeing too much wit

Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip

To know myself the wisest knight of all.'

`Ay, fool,' said Tristram, `but 'tis eating dry

To dance without a catch, a roundelay

To dance to.'  Then he twangled on his harp,

And while he twangled little Dagonet stood

Quiet as any water-sodden log

Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;

But when the twangling ended, skipt again;

And being asked, `Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?'

Made answer, `I had liefer twenty years

Skip to the broken music of my brains

Than any broken music thou canst make.'

Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,

`Good now, what music have I broken, fool?'

And little Dagonet, skipping, `Arthur, the King's;

For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,

Thou makest broken music with thy bride,

Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--

And so thou breakest Arthur's music too.'

`Save for that broken music in thy brains,

Sir Fool,' said Tristram, `I would break thy head.

Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o'er,

The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--

I am but a fool to reason with a fool--

Come, thou art crabbed and sour:  but lean me down,

Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,

And harken if my music be not true.


`"Free love--free field--we love but while we may:

The woods are hushed, their music is no more:

The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:

New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:

New life, new love, to suit the newer day:

New loves are sweet as those that went before:

Free love--free field--we love but while we may."


`Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,

Not stood stockstill.  I made it in the woods,

And heard it ring as true as tested gold.'


But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,

`Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday

Made to run wine?--but this had run itself

All out like a long life to a sour end--

And them that round it sat with golden cups

To hand the wine to whosoever came--

The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,

In honour of poor Innocence the babe,

Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen

Lent to the King, and Innocence the King

Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips

Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,

"Drink, drink, Sir Fool," and thereupon I drank,

Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud.'


And Tristram, `Was it muddier than thy gibes?

Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--

Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--

"Fear God:  honour the King--his one true knight--

Sole follower of the vows"--for here be they

Who knew thee swine enow before I came,

Smuttier than blasted grain:  but when the King

Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up

It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;

Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,

A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,

For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.'


And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,

`Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck

In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch

Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.

Swine?  I have wallowed, I have washed--the world

Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.

The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind

Hath fouled me--an I wallowed, then I washed--

I have had my day and my philosophies--

And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.

Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese

Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed

On such a wire as musically as thou

Some such fine song--but never a king's fool.'


And Tristram, `Then were swine, goats, asses, geese

The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard

Had such a mastery of his mystery

That he could harp his wife up out of hell.'


Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,

`And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself

Down! and two more:  a helpful harper thou,

That harpest downward!  Dost thou know the star

We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?'


And Tristram, `Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King

Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,

Glorying in each new glory, set his name

High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.'


And Dagonet answered, `Ay, and when the land

Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself

To babble about him, all to show your wit--

And whether he were King by courtesy,

Or King by right--and so went harping down

The black king's highway, got so far, and grew

So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes

With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.

Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?'


`Nay, fool,' said Tristram, `not in open day.'

And Dagonet, `Nay, nor will:  I see it and hear.

It makes a silent music up in heaven,

And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,

And then we skip.'  `Lo, fool,' he said, `ye talk

Fool's treason:  is the King thy brother fool?'

Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,

`Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!

Conceits himself as God that he can make

Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk

From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,

And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!'


And down the city Dagonet danced away;

But through the slowly-mellowing avenues

And solitary passes of the wood

Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.

Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt

With ruby-circled neck, but evermore

Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood

Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye

For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.

Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,

Unruffling waters re-collect the shape

Of one that in them sees himself, returned;

But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,

Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.


So on for all that day from lawn to lawn

Through many a league-long bower he rode.  At length

A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs

Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself

Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt

Against a shower, dark in the golden grove

Appearing, sent his fancy back to where

She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:

Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,

With six or seven, when Tristram was away,

And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame

Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,

But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.


And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt

So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank

Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;

But could not rest for musing how to smoothe

And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.

Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all

The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.

But then what folly had sent him overseas

After she left him lonely here? a name?

Was it the name of one in Brittany,

Isolt, the daughter of the King?  `Isolt

Of the white hands' they called her:  the sweet name

Allured him first, and then the maid herself,

Who served him well with those white hands of hers,

And loved him well, until himself had thought

He loved her also, wedded easily,

But left her all as easily, and returned.

The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes

Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid

His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.


He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany

Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,

And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both

Began to struggle for it, till his Queen

Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.

Then cried the Breton, `Look, her hand is red!

These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,

And melts within her hand--her hand is hot

With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,

Is all as cool and white as any flower.'

Followed a rush of eagle's wings, and then

A whimpering of the spirit of the child,

Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.


He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears

Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,

And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,

The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh

Glared on a huge machicolated tower

That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled

A roar of riot, as from men secure

Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease

Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.

`Lo there,' said one of Arthur's youth, for there,

High on a grim dead tree before the tower,

A goodly brother of the Table Round

Swung by the neck:  and on the boughs a shield

Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,

And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights

At that dishonour done the gilded spur,

Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.

But Arthur waved them back.  Alone he rode.

Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,

That sent the face of all the marsh aloft

An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud

Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,

Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,

In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,


`The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!--

Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King

Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--

The woman-worshipper?  Yea, God's curse, and I!

Slain was the brother of my paramour

By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine

And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,

Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,

And stings itself to everlasting death,

To hang whatever knight of thine I fought

And tumbled.  Art thou King? --Look to thy life!'


He ended:  Arthur knew the voice; the face

Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name

Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.

And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,

But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse

To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,

Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp

Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,

Heard in dead night along that table-shore,

Drops flat, and after the great waters break

Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,

Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,

From less and less to nothing; thus he fell

Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared

And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;

There trampled out his face from being known,

And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:

Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang

Through open doors, and swording right and left

Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled

The tables over and the wines, and slew

Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,

And all the pavement streamed with massacre:

Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,

Which half that autumn night, like the live North,

Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,

Made all above it, and a hundred meres

About it, as the water Moab saw

Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed

The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.


So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,

But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.


Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream

Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,

Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.

He whistled his good warhorse left to graze

Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,

And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,

Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,

Stayed him.  `Why weep ye?'  `Lord,' she said, `my man

Hath left me or is dead;' whereon he thought--

`What, if she hate me now? I would not this.

What, if she love me still? I would not that.

I know not what I would'--but said to her,

`Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,

He find thy favour changed and love thee not'--

Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse

Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard

The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds

Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained

Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,

A crown of towers.


                 Down in a casement sat,

A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair

And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.

And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind

The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,

Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there

Belted his body with her white embrace,

Crying aloud, `Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!

The footstep fluttered me at first:  not he:

Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,

But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls

Who hates thee, as I him--even to the death.

My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark

Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.'

To whom Sir Tristram smiling, `I am here.

Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.'


And drawing somewhat backward she replied,

`Can he be wronged who is not even his own,

But save for dread of thee had beaten me,

Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow--Mark?

What rights are his that dare not strike for them?

Not lift a hand--not, though he found me thus!

But harken! have ye met him? hence he went

Today for three days' hunting--as he said--

And so returns belike within an hour.

Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,

Because he hates thee even more than fears;

Nor drink:  and when thou passest any wood

Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush

Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.

My God, the measure of my hate for Mark

Is as the measure of my love for thee.'


So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,

Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake

To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,

`O hunter, and O blower of the horn,

Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,

For, ere I mated with my shambling king,

Ye twain had fallen out about the bride

Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,

If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)--

Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks

To wreck thee villainously:  but, O Sir Knight,

What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?'


And Tristram, `Last to my Queen Paramount,

Here now to my Queen Paramount of love

And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first

Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,

Sailing from Ireland.'


                     Softly laughed Isolt;

`Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen

My dole of beauty trebled?' and he said,

`Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,

And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--

Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips

Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,

Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow

To make one doubt if ever the great Queen

Have yielded him her love.'


                          To whom Isolt,

`Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou

Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,

Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me

That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,

And I--misyoked with such a want of man--

That I could hardly sin against the lowest.'


He answered, `O my soul, be comforted!

If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,

If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,

Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin

That made us happy:  but how ye greet me--fear

And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--

Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories

Of Tristram in that year he was away.'


And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,

`I had forgotten all in my strong joy

To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,

Here in the never-ended afternoon,

O sweeter than all memories of thee,

Deeper than any yearnings after thee

Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,

Watched from this tower.  Isolt of Britain dashed

Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,

Would that have chilled her bride-kiss?  Wedded her?

Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?

The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,

And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed

Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--

Well--can I wish her any huger wrong

Than having known thee? her too hast thou left

To pine and waste in those sweet memories.

O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men

Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.'


And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,

`Grace, Queen, for being loved:  she loved me well.

Did I love her? the name at least I loved.

Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!

The night was dark; the true star set.  Isolt!

The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?

Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,

Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.'


And Isolt answered, `Yea, and why not I?

Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,

Pale-blooded, prayerful.  Let me tell thee now.

Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,

Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,

Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,

And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.

Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,

In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--

Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--

For there was Mark:  "He has wedded her," he said,

Not said, but hissed it:  then this crown of towers

So shook to such a roar of all the sky,

That here in utter dark I swooned away,

And woke again in utter dark, and cried,

"I will flee hence and give myself to God"--

And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms.'


Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,

`May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,

And past desire!' a saying that angered her.

`"May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,

And sweet no more to me!"  I need Him now.

For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross

Even to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?

The greater man, the greater courtesy.

Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!

But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts--

Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance

Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.

How darest thou, if lover, push me even

In fancy from thy side, and set me far

In the gray distance, half a life away,

Her to be loved no more?  Unsay it, unswear!

Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,

Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,

Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck

Lies like sweet wines:  lie to me:  I believe.

Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,

And solemnly as when ye sware to him,

The man of men, our King--My God, the power

Was once in vows when men believed the King!

They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows

The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,

Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,

Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.'


Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,

`Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark

More than I mine?  Lied, say ye?  Nay, but learnt,

The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--

My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--

We run more counter to the soul thereof

Than had we never sworn.  I swear no more.

I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.

For once--even to the height--I honoured him.

"Man, is he man at all?" methought, when first

I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld

That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--

His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow

Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,

The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--

Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,

With Merlin's mystic babble about his end

Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool

Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,

But Micha l trampling Satan; so I sware,

Being amazed:  but this went by-- The vows!

O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--

They served their use, their time; for every knight

Believed himself a greater than himself,

And every follower eyed him as a God;

Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,

Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,

And so the realm was made; but then their vows--

First mainly through that sullying of our Queen--

Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence

Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?

Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?

They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood

Of our old kings:  whence then? a doubtful lord

To bind them by inviolable vows,

Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:

For feel this arm of mine--the tide within

Red with free chase and heather-scented air,

Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure

As any maiden child? lock up my tongue

From uttering freely what I freely hear?

Bind me to one?  The wide world laughs at it.

And worldling of the world am I, and know

The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour

Woos his own end; we are not angels here

Nor shall be:  vows--I am woodman of the woods,

And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale

Mock them:  my soul, we love but while we may;

And therefore is my love so large for thee,

Seeing it is not bounded save by love.'


Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,

`Good:  an I turned away my love for thee

To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--

For courtesy wins woman all as well

As valour may, but he that closes both

Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,

Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved

This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back

Thine own small saw, "We love but while we may,"

Well then, what answer?'


                       He that while she spake,

Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,

The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch

The warm white apple of her throat, replied,

`Press this a little closer, sweet, until--

Come, I am hungered and half-angered--meat,

Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,

And out beyond into the dream to come.'


So then, when both were brought to full accord,

She rose, and set before him all he willed;

And after these had comforted the blood

With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--

Now talking of their woodland paradise,

The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;

Now mocking at the much ungainliness,

And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--

Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:


`Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!

A star in heaven, a star within the mere!

Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,

And one was far apart, and one was near:

Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!

And one was water and one star was fire,

And one will ever shine and one will pass.

Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere.'


Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram showed

And swung the ruby carcanet.  She cried,

`The collar of some Order, which our King

Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,

For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.'


`Not so, my Queen,' he said, `but the red fruit

Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,

And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,

And hither brought by Tristram for his last

Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.'


He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,

Claspt it, and cried, `Thine Order, O my Queen!'

But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,

Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,

Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--

`Mark's way,' said Mark, and clove him through the brain.


That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,

All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,

The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw

The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet

A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,

`What art thou?' and the voice about his feet

Sent up an answer, sobbing, `I am thy fool,

And I shall never make thee smile again.'

Poem 127: The Letters

Still on the tower stood the vane,

A black yew gloomed the stagnant air,

I peered athwart the chancel pane

And saw the altar cold and bare.

A clog of lead was round my feet,

A band of pain across my brow;

"Cold altar, Heaven and earth shall meet

Before you hear my marriage vow."


I turned and hummed a bitter song

That mocked the wholesome human heart,

And then we met in wrath and wrong,

We met, but only met to part.

Full cold my greeting was and dry;

She faintly smiled, she hardly moved;

I saw with half-unconscious eye

She wore the colours I approved.


She took the little ivory chest,

With half a sigh she turned the key,

Then raised her head with lips comprest,

And gave my letters back to me.

And gave the trinkets and the rings,

My gifts, when gifts of mine could please;

As looks a father on the things

Of his dead son, I looked on these.


She told me all her friends had said;

I raged against the public liar;

She talked as if her love were dead,

But in my words were seeds of fire.

"No more of love; your sex is known:

I never will be twice deceived.

Henceforth I trust the man alone,

The woman cannot be believed.


Through slander, meanest spawn of Hell -

And woman's slander is the worst,

And you, whom once I loved so well,

Through you, my life will be accurst."

I spoke with heart, and heat and force,

I shook her breast with vague alarms -

Like torrents from a mountain's source

We rushed into each other's arms.


We parted: sweetly gleamed the stars,

And sweet the vapour-braided blue,

Low breezes fanned the belfry bars,

As homeward by the church I drew.

The very graves appeared to smile,

So fresh they rose in shadowed swells;

"Dark porch," I said, "and silent aisle,

There comes a sound of marriage bells."

Poem 128: The Lord of Burleigh

IN her ear he whispers gaily,

     'If my heart by signs can tell,

Maiden, I have watch'd thee daily,

     And I think thou lov'st me well.'

She replies, in accents fainter,

     'There is none I love like thee.'

He is but a landscape-painter,

     And a village maiden she.

He to lips, that fondly falter,

     Presses his without reproof:

Leads her to the village altar,

     And they leave her father's roo£

'I can make no marriage present:

     Little can I give my wife.

Love will make our cottage pleasant,

     And I love thee more than life.'

They by parks and lodges going

     See the lordly castles stand:

Summer woods, about them blowing,

     Made a murmur in the land.

From deep thought himself he rouses,

     Says to her that loves him well,

'Let us see these handsome houses

     Where the wealthy nobles dwell.'

So she goes by him attended,

     Hears him lovingly converse,

Sees whatever fair and splendid

     Lay betwixt his home and hers;

Parks with oak and chestnut shady,

     Parks and order'd gardens great,

Ancient homes of lord and lady,

     Built for pleasure and for state.

All he shows her makes him dearer:

     Evermore she seems to gaze

On that cottage growing nearer,

     Where they twain will spend their days.

O but she will love him truly !

     He shall have a cheerful home;

She will order all things duly,

     When beneath his roof they come.

Thus her heart rejoices greatly,

     Till a gateway she discerns

With armorial bearings stately,

     And beneath the gate she turns;

Sees a mansion more majestic

     Than all those she saw before:

Many a gallant gay domestic

     Bows before him at the door.

And they speak in gentle murmur,

     When they answer to his call,

While he treads with footstep firmer,

     Leading on from hall to hall.

And, while now she wonders blindly,

     Nor the meaning can divine,

Proudly turns he round and kindly,

     'All of this is mine and thine.'

Here he lives in state and bounty,

     Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,

Not a lord in all the county

     Is so great a lord as he.

All at once the colour flushes

     Her sweet face from brow to chin:

As it were with shame she blushes,

     And her spirit changed within.

Then her countenance all over

     Pale again as death did prove:

But he clasp'd her like a lover,

     And he cheer'd her soul with love.

So she strove against her weakness,

     Tho' at times her spirit sank:

Shaped her heart with woman's meekness

     To all duties of her rank:

And a gentle consort made he,

     And her gentle mind was such

That she grew a noble lady,

     And the people loved her much.

But a trouble weigh'd upon her,

     And perplex'd her, night and morn,

With the burthen of an honour

     Unto which she was not born.

Faint she grew, and ever fainter,

     And she murmur'd, 'Oh, that he

Were once more that landscape-painter,

     Which did win my heart from me!'

So she droop'd and droop'd before him,

     Fading slowly from his side:

Three fair children first she bore him,

     Then before her time she died.

Weeping, weeping late and early,

     Walking up and pacing down,

Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,

     Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.

And he came to look upon her,

     And he look'd at her and said,

'Bring the dress and put it on her,

     That she wore when she was wed.'

Then her people, softly treading,

     Bore to earth her body, drest

In the dress that she was wed in,

     That her spirit might have rest.

Poem 129: The Lotos-eaters

"Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land,

   "This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."

   In the afternoon they came unto a land

   In which it seemed always afternoon.

   All round the coast the languid air did swoon,

   Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.

   Full-faced above the valley stood the moon;

   And like a downward smoke, the slender stream

   Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.


  A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,

  Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;

  And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,

  Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.

  They saw the gleaming river seaward flow

  From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops,

  Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,

  Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops,

  Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.


  The charmed sunset linger'd low adown

  In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale

  Was seen far inland, and the yellow down

  Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale

  And meadow, set with slender galingale;

  A land where all things always seem'd the same!

  And round about the keel with faces pale,

  Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,

  The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.


  Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,

  Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave

  To each, but whoso did receive of them,

  And taste, to him the gushing of the wave

  Far far away did seem to mourn and rave

  On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,

  His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;

  And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,

  And music in his ears his beating heart did make.


  They sat them down upon the yellow sand,

  Between the sun and moon upon the shore;

  And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,

  Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore

  Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar,

  Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.

  Then some one said, "We will return no more";

  And all at once they sang, "Our island home

  Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam."


CHORIC SONG I


  There is sweet music here that softer falls

  Than petals from blown roses on the grass,

  Or night-dews on still waters between walls

  Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;

  Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,

  Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes;

  Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.

  Here are cool mosses deep,

  And thro' the moss the ivies creep,

  And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,

  And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep."


II


  Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness,

  And utterly consumed with sharp distress,

  While all things else have rest from weariness?

   All things have rest: why should we toil alone,

  We only toil, who are the first of things,

  And make perpetual moan,

  Still from one sorrow to another thrown:

  Nor ever fold our wings,

  And cease from wanderings,

  Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;

  Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,

  "There is no joy but calm!"

  Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?


III


  Lo! in the middle of the wood,

  The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud

  With winds upon the branch, and there

  Grows green and broad, and takes no care,

  Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon

  Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow

  Falls, and floats adown the air.

  Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,

  The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,

  Drops in a silent autumn night.

  All its allotted length of days

  The flower ripens in its place,

  Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,

  Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil.


IV


  Hateful is the dark-blue sky,

  Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea.

  Death is the end of life; ah, why

  Should life all labour be?

  Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast,

  And in a little while our lips are dumb.

  Let us alone. What is it that will last?

  All things are taken from us, and become

  Portions and parcels of the dreadful past.

  Let us alone. What pleasure can we have

  To war with evil? Is there any peace

  In ever climbing up the climbing wave?

  All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave

  In silence; ripen, fall and cease:

  Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.


V


  How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,

 With half-shut eyes ever to seem

 Falling asleep in a half-dream!

 To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,

 Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;

 To hear each other's whisper'd speech;

 Eating the Lotos day by day,

 To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,

 And tender curving lines of creamy spray;

 To lend our hearts and spirits wholly

 To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;

 To muse and brood and live again in memory,

 With those old faces of our infancy

 Heap'd over with a mound of grass,

 Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!


VI



 Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,

 And dear the last embraces of our wives

 And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change:

 For surely now our household hearths are cold,

 Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:

 And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.

 Or else the island princes over-bold

 Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings

 Before them of the ten years' war in Troy,

 And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.

 Is there confusion in the little isle?

 Let what is broken so remain.

 The Gods are hard to reconcile:

 'Tis hard to settle order once again.

 There is confusion worse than death,

 Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,

 Long labour unto aged breath,

 Sore task to hearts worn out by many wars

 And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.


VII



 But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly,

 How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)

 With half-dropt eyelid still,

 Beneath a heaven dark and holy,

 To watch the long bright river drawing slowly

 His waters from the purple hill--

 To hear the dewy echoes calling

 From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine--

 To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling

 Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!

 Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,

 Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine.


VIII



 The Lotos blooms below the barren peak:

 The Lotos blows by every winding creek:

 All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:

 Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone

 Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.

 We have had enough of action, and of motion we,

 Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free,

 Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.

 Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,

 In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined

 On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.

 For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd

 Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd

 Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:

 Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,

 Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,

 Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands.

 But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song

 Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,

 Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong;

 Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,

 Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,

 Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;

 Till they perish and they suffer--some, 'tis whisper'd--down in hell

 Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,

 Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.

 Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore

 Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;

 O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.

Poem 130: The Marriage Of Geraint

The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,

A tributary prince of Devon, one

Of that great Order of the Table Round,

Had married Enid, Yniol's only child,

And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.

And as the light of Heaven varies, now

At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night

With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint

To make her beauty vary day by day,

In crimsons and in purples and in gems.

And Enid, but to please her husband's eye,

Who first had found and loved her in a state

Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him

In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,

Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,

Loved her, and often with her own white hands

Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,

Next after her own self, in all the court.

And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart

Adored her, as the stateliest and the best

And loveliest of all women upon earth.

And seeing them so tender and so close,

Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.

But when a rumour rose about the Queen,

Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,

Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard

The world's loud whisper breaking into storm,

Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell

A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,

Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,

Had suffered, or should suffer any taint

In nature:  wherefore going to the King,

He made this pretext, that his princedom lay

Close on the borders of a territory,

Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,

Assassins, and all flyers from the hand

Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:

And therefore, till the King himself should please

To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,

He craved a fair permission to depart,

And there defend his marches; and the King

Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,

Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,

And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores

Of Severn, and they past to their own land;

Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife

True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,

He compassed her with sweet observances

And worship, never leaving her, and grew

Forgetful of his promise to the King,

Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,

Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,

Forgetful of his glory and his name,

Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.

And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.

And by and by the people, when they met

In twos and threes, or fuller companies,

Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him

As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,

And molten down in mere uxoriousness.

And this she gathered from the people's eyes:

This too the women who attired her head,

To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,

Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:

And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,

But could not out of bashful delicacy;

While he that watched her sadden, was the more

Suspicious that her nature had a taint.


At last, it chanced that on a summer morn

(They sleeping each by either) the new sun

Beat through the blindless casement of the room,

And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;

Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,

And bared the knotted column of his throat,

The massive square of his heroic breast,

And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,

As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,

Running too vehemently to break upon it.

And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,

Admiring him, and thought within herself,

Was ever man so grandly made as he?

Then, like a shadow, past the people's talk

And accusation of uxoriousness

Across her mind, and bowing over him,

Low to her own heart piteously she said:


'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,

Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men

Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?

I AM the cause, because I dare not speak

And tell him what I think and what they say.

And yet I hate that he should linger here;

I cannot love my lord and not his name.

Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,

And ride with him to battle and stand by,

And watch his mightful hand striking great blows

At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.

Far better were I laid in the dark earth,

Not hearing any more his noble voice,

Not to be folded more in these dear arms,

And darkened from the high light in his eyes,

Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.

Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,

And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,

And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,

And yet not dare to tell him what I think,

And how men slur him, saying all his force

Is melted into mere effeminacy?

O me, I fear that I am no true wife.'


Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,

And the strong passion in her made her weep

True tears upon his broad and naked breast,

And these awoke him, and by great mischance

He heard but fragments of her later words,

And that she feared she was not a true wife.

And then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,

For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,

She is not faithful to me, and I see her

Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'

Then though he loved and reverenced her too much

To dream she could be guilty of foul act,

Right through his manful breast darted the pang

That makes a man, in the sweet face of her

Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.

At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,

And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,

'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,

'I will ride forth into the wilderness;

For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,

I have not fallen so low as some would wish.

And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress

And ride with me.'  And Enid asked, amazed,

'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'

But he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'

Then she bethought her of a faded silk,

A faded mantle and a faded veil,

And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,

Wherein she kept them folded reverently

With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,

She took them, and arrayed herself therein,

Remembering when first he came on her

Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,

And all her foolish fears about the dress,

And all his journey to her, as himself

Had told her, and their coming to the court.


For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before

Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.

There on a day, he sitting high in hall,

Before him came a forester of Dean,

Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart

Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,

First seen that day:  these things he told the King.

Then the good King gave order to let blow

His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.

And when the King petitioned for his leave

To see the hunt, allowed it easily.

So with the morning all the court were gone.

But Guinevere lay late into the morn,

Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love

For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;

But rose at last, a single maiden with her,

Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;

There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed

Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead

A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,

Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress

Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,

Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford

Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.

A purple scarf, at either end whereof

There swung an apple of the purest gold,

Swayed round about him, as he galloped up

To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly

In summer suit and silks of holiday.

Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,

Sweet and statelily, and with all grace

Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:

'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'

'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late

That I but come like you to see the hunt,

Not join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;

'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,

There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:

Here often they break covert at our feet.'


And while they listened for the distant hunt,

And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,

King Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode

Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;

Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight

Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,

Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.

And Guinevere, not mindful of his face

In the King's hall, desired his name, and sent

Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;

Who being vicious, old and irritable,

And doubling all his master's vice of pride,

Made answer sharply that she should not know.

'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.

'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;

'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'

And when she put her horse toward the knight,

Struck at her with his whip, and she returned

Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint

Exclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'

Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,

Who answered as before; and when the Prince

Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,

Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.

The Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,

Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand

Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:

But he, from his exceeding manfulness

And pure nobility of temperament,

Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained

From even a word, and so returning said:


'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,

Done in your maiden's person to yourself:

And I will track this vermin to their earths:

For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt

To find, at some place I shall come at, arms

On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,

Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,

And on the third day will again be here,

So that I be not fallen in fight.  Farewell.'


'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.

'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;

And may you light on all things that you love,

And live to wed with her whom first you love:

But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,

And I, were she the daughter of a king,

Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,

Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'


And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard

The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,

A little vext at losing of the hunt,

A little at the vile occasion, rode,

By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade

And valley, with fixt eye following the three.

At last they issued from the world of wood,

And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,

And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.

And thither there came Geraint, and underneath

Beheld the long street of a little town

In a long valley, on one side whereof,

White from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;

And on one side a castle in decay,

Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:

And out of town and valley came a noise

As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed

Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks

At distance, ere they settle for the night.


And onward to the fortress rode the three,

And entered, and were lost behind the walls.

'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'

And down the long street riding wearily,

Found every hostel full, and everywhere

Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss

And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured

His master's armour; and of such a one

He asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'

Who told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'

Then riding close behind an ancient churl,

Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,

Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,

Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?

Who answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'

Then riding further past an armourer's,

Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,

Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,

He put the self-same query, but the man

Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:

'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk

Has little time for idle questioners.'

Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:

'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!

Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!

Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg

The murmur of the world!  What is it to me?

O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,

Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!

Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,

Where can I get me harbourage for the night?

And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy?  Speak!'

Whereat the armourer turning all amazed

And seeing one so gay in purple silks,

Came forward with the helmet yet in hand

And answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;

We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,

And there is scantly time for half the work.

Arms? truth! I know not:  all are wanted here.

Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,

It may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge

Yonder.'  He spoke and fell to work again.


Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,

Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.

There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,

(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,

Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:

'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,

'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'

Then Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake

The slender entertainment of a house

Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'

'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;

'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks

For supper, I will enter, I will eat

With all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'

Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,

And answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine

To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:

But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,

We will not touch upon him even in jest.'


Then rode Geraint into the castle court,

His charger trampling many a prickly star

Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.

He looked and saw that all was ruinous.

Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;

And here had fallen a great part of a tower,

Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,

And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:

And high above a piece of turret stair,

Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound

Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems

Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,

And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked

A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.


And while he waited in the castle court,

The voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang

Clear through the open casement of the hall,

Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,

Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,

Moves him to think what kind of bird it is

That sings so delicately clear, and make

Conjecture of the plumage and the form;

So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;

And made him like a man abroad at morn

When first the liquid note beloved of men

Comes flying over many a windy wave

To Britain, and in April suddenly

Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,

And he suspends his converse with a friend,

Or it may be the labour of his hands,

To think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'

So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,

'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'


It chanced the song that Enid sang was one

Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:


'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;

Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;

Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.


'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;

With that wild wheel we go not up or down;

Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.


'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;

Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;

For man is man and master of his fate.


'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;

Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;

Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'


'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'

Said Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,

Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,

The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,

He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;

And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,

That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,

Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,

Her daughter.  In a moment thought Geraint,

'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'

But none spake word except the hoary Earl:

'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;

Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then

Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;

And we will make us merry as we may.

Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'


He spake:  the Prince, as Enid past him, fain

To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught

His purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!

Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,

Endures not that her guest should serve himself.'

And reverencing the custom of the house

Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.


So Enid took his charger to the stall;

And after went her way across the bridge,

And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl

Yet spoke together, came again with one,

A youth, that following with a costrel bore

The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.

And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,

And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.

And then, because their hall must also serve

For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,

And stood behind, and waited on the three.

And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,

Geraint had longing in him evermore

To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,

That crost the trencher as she laid it down:

But after all had eaten, then Geraint,

For now the wine made summer in his veins,

Let his eye rove in following, or rest

On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,

Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;

Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:


'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;

This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.

His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:

For if he be the knight whom late I saw

Ride into that new fortress by your town,

White from the mason's hand, then have I sworn

From his own lips to have it--I am Geraint

Of Devon--for this morning when the Queen

Sent her own maiden to demand the name,

His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,

Struck at her with his whip, and she returned

Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore

That I would track this caitiff to his hold,

And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.

And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find

Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;

They take the rustic murmur of their bourg

For the great wave that echoes round the world;

They would not hear me speak:  but if ye know

Where I can light on arms, or if yourself

Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn

That I will break his pride and learn his name,

Avenging this great insult done the Queen.'


Then cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,

Geraint, a name far-sounded among men

For noble deeds? and truly I, when first

I saw you moving by me on the bridge,

Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state

And presence might have guessed you one of those

That eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.

Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;

For this dear child hath often heard me praise

Your feats of arms, and often when I paused

Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;

So grateful is the noise of noble deeds

To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:

O never yet had woman such a pair

Of suitors as this maiden:  first Limours,

A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,

Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead

I know not, but he past to the wild land.

The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,

My curse, my nephew--I will not let his name

Slip from my lips if I can help it--he,

When that I knew him fierce and turbulent

Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;

And since the proud man often is the mean,

He sowed a slander in the common ear,

Affirming that his father left him gold,

And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;

Bribed with large promises the men who served

About my person, the more easily

Because my means were somewhat broken into

Through open doors and hospitality;

Raised my own town against me in the night

Before my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;

From mine own earldom foully ousted me;

Built that new fort to overawe my friends,

For truly there are those who love me yet;

And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,

Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,

But that his pride too much despises me:

And I myself sometimes despise myself;

For I have let men be, and have their way;

Am much too gentle, have not used my power:

Nor know I whether I be very base

Or very manful, whether very wise

Or very foolish; only this I know,

That whatsoever evil happen to me,

I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,

But can endure it all most patiently.'


'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,

That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight

In next day's tourney I may break his pride.'


And Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old

And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,

Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.

But in this tournament can no man tilt,

Except the lady he loves best be there.

Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,

And over these is placed a silver wand,

And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,

The prize of beauty for the fairest there.

And this, what knight soever be in field

Lays claim to for the lady at his side,

And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,

Who being apt at arms and big of bone

Has ever won it for the lady with him,

And toppling over all antagonism

Has earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'

But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'


To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,

Leaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!

Let ME lay lance in rest, O noble host,

For this dear child, because I never saw,

Though having seen all beauties of our time,

Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.

And if I fall her name will yet remain

Untarnished as before; but if I live,

So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,

As I will make her truly my true wife.'


Then, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart

Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,

And looking round he saw not Enid there,

(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)

But that old dame, to whom full tenderly

And folding all her hand in his he said,

'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,

And best by her that bore her understood.

Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest

Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'


So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she

With frequent smile and nod departing found,

Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;

Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then

On either shining shoulder laid a hand,

And kept her off and gazed upon her face,

And told them all their converse in the hall,

Proving her heart:  but never light and shade

Coursed one another more on open ground

Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale

Across the face of Enid hearing her;

While slowly falling as a scale that falls,

When weight is added only grain by grain,

Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;

Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,

Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;

So moving without answer to her rest

She found no rest, and ever failed to draw

The quiet night into her blood, but lay

Contemplating her own unworthiness;

And when the pale and bloodless east began

To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised

Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved

Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,

And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.


And thither came the twain, and when Geraint

Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,

He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,

Himself beyond the rest pushing could move

The chair of Idris.  Yniol's rusted arms

Were on his princely person, but through these

Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights

And ladies came, and by and by the town

Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.

And there they fixt the forks into the ground,

And over these they placed the silver wand,

And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.

Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,

Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,

'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,

What I these two years past have won for thee,

The prize of beauty.'  Loudly spake the Prince,

'Forbear:  there is a worthier,' and the knight

With some surprise and thrice as much disdain

Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face

Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,

So burnt he was with passion, crying out,

'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice

They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.

Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each

So often and with such blows, that all the crowd

Wondered, and now and then from distant walls

There came a clapping as of phantom hands.

So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still

The dew of their great labour, and the blood

Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.

But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,

'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'

Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,

And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,

And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,

And said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen man

Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!

Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.

My pride is broken:  men have seen my fall.'

'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,

'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.

First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,

Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,

Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,

And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,

Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.

These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'

And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,

For I have never yet been overthrown,

And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride

Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'

And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,

And there the Queen forgave him easily.

And being young, he changed and came to loathe

His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself

Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last

In the great battle fighting for the King.


But when the third day from the hunting-morn

Made a low splendour in the world, and wings

Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay

With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,

Among the dancing shadows of the birds,

Woke and bethought her of her promise given

No later than last eve to Prince Geraint--

So bent he seemed on going the third day,

He would not leave her, till her promise given--

To ride with him this morning to the court,

And there be made known to the stately Queen,

And there be wedded with all ceremony.

At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,

And thought it never yet had looked so mean.

For as a leaf in mid-November is

To what it is in mid-October, seemed

The dress that now she looked on to the dress

She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.

And still she looked, and still the terror grew

Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,

All staring at her in her faded silk:

And softly to her own sweet heart she said:


'This noble prince who won our earldom back,

So splendid in his acts and his attire,

Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!

Would he could tarry with us here awhile,

But being so beholden to the Prince,

It were but little grace in any of us,

Bent as he seemed on going this third day,

To seek a second favour at his hands.

Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,

Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,

Far liefer than so much discredit him.'


And Enid fell in longing for a dress

All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift

Of her good mother, given her on the night

Before her birthday, three sad years ago,

That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,

And scattered all they had to all the winds:

For while the mother showed it, and the two

Were turning and admiring it, the work

To both appeared so costly, rose a cry

That Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled

With little save the jewels they had on,

Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:

And Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,

And placed them in this ruin; and she wished

The Prince had found her in her ancient home;

Then let her fancy flit across the past,

And roam the goodly places that she knew;

And last bethought her how she used to watch,

Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;

And one was patched and blurred and lustreless

Among his burnished brethren of the pool;

And half asleep she made comparison

Of that and these to her own faded self

And the gay court, and fell asleep again;

And dreamt herself was such a faded form

Among her burnished sisters of the pool;

But this was in the garden of a king;

And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew

That all was bright; that all about were birds

Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;

That all the turf was rich in plots that looked

Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;

And lords and ladies of the high court went

In silver tissue talking things of state;

And children of the King in cloth of gold

Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;

And while she thought 'They will not see me,' came

A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,

And all the children in their cloth of gold

Ran to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all

Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now

To pick the faded creature from the pool,

And cast it on the mixen that it die.'

And therewithal one came and seized on her,

And Enid started waking, with her heart

All overshadowed by the foolish dream,

And lo! it was her mother grasping her

To get her well awake; and in her hand

A suit of bright apparel, which she laid

Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:


'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,

How fast they hold like colours of a shell

That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.

Why not?  It never yet was worn, I trow:

Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'


And Enid looked, but all confused at first,

Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:

Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,

And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,

So sadly lost on that unhappy night;

Your own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,

'And gladly given again this happy morn.

For when the jousts were ended yesterday,

Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere

He found the sack and plunder of our house

All scattered through the houses of the town;

And gave command that all which once was ours

Should now be ours again:  and yester-eve,

While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,

Came one with this and laid it in my hand,

For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,

Because we have our earldom back again.

And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,

But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.

Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?

For I myself unwillingly have worn

My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,

And howsoever patient, Yniol his.

Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,

With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,

And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,

And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all

That appertains to noble maintenance.

Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;

But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,

And all through that young traitor, cruel need

Constrained us, but a better time has come;

So clothe yourself in this, that better fits

Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:

For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,

And though I heard him call you fairest fair,

Let never maiden think, however fair,

She is not fairer in new clothes than old.

And should some great court-lady say, the Prince

Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,

And like a madman brought her to the court,

Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince

To whom we are beholden; but I know,

That when my dear child is set forth at her best,

That neither court nor country, though they sought

Through all the provinces like those of old

That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'


Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;

And Enid listened brightening as she lay;

Then, as the white and glittering star of morn

Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by

Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,

And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,

Helped by the mother's careful hand and eye,

Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;

Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,

She never yet had seen her half so fair;

And called her like that maiden in the tale,

Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers

And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,

Flur, for whose love the Roman Csar first

Invaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,

As this great Prince invaded us, and we,

Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy

And I can scarcely ride with you to court,

For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;

But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream

I see my princess as I see her now,

Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'


But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint

Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called

For Enid, and when Yniol made report

Of that good mother making Enid gay

In such apparel as might well beseem

His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,

He answered:  'Earl, entreat her by my love,

Albeit I give no reason but my wish,

That she ride with me in her faded silk.'

Yniol with that hard message went; it fell

Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:

For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,

Dared not to glance at her good mother's face,

But silently, in all obedience,

Her mother silent too, nor helping her,

Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,

And robed them in her ancient suit again,

And so descended.  Never man rejoiced

More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;

And glancing all at once as keenly at her

As careful robins eye the delver's toil,

Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,

But rested with her sweet face satisfied;

Then seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,

Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,


'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved

At thy new son, for my petition to her.

When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,

In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,

Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,

Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.

Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,

Beholding one so bright in dark estate,

I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,

No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst

Sunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,

That service done so graciously would bind

The two together; fain I would the two

Should love each other:  how can Enid find

A nobler friend?  Another thought was mine;

I came among you here so suddenly,

That though her gentle presence at the lists

Might well have served for proof that I was loved,

I doubted whether daughter's tenderness,

Or easy nature, might not let itself

Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;

Or whether some false sense in her own self

Of my contrasting brightness, overbore

Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;

And such a sense might make her long for court

And all its perilous glories:  and I thought,

That could I someway prove such force in her

Linked with such love for me, that at a word

(No reason given her) she could cast aside

A splendour dear to women, new to her,

And therefore dearer; or if not so new,

Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power

Of intermitted usage; then I felt

That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,

Fixt on her faith.  Now, therefore, I do rest,

A prophet certain of my prophecy,

That never shadow of mistrust can cross

Between us.  Grant me pardon for my thoughts:

And for my strange petition I will make

Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,

When your fair child shall wear your costly gift

Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,

Who knows? another gift of the high God,

Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'


He spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,

Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,

And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.


Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed

The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,

Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,

And white sails flying on the yellow sea;

But not to goodly hill or yellow sea

Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,

By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;

And then descending met them at the gates,

Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,

And did her honour as the Prince's bride,

And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;

And all that week was old Caerleon gay,

For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,

They twain were wedded with all ceremony.


And this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.

But Enid ever kept the faded silk,

Remembering how first he came on her,

Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,

And all her foolish fears about the dress,

And all his journey toward her, as himself

Had told her, and their coming to the court.


And now this morning when he said to her,

'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found

And took it, and arrayed herself therein.

Poem 131: The Mermaid

I


Who would be

A mermaid fair,

Singing alone,

Combing her hair

Under the sea,

In a golden curl

With a comb of pearl,

On a throne?


II


   I would be a mermaid fair;

I would sing to myself the whole of the day;

With a comb of pearl I would comb my hair;

And still as I comb'd I would sing and say,

'Who is it loves me? who loves not me?'

I would comb my hair till my ringlets would fall

       Low adown, low adown,

From under my starry sea-bud crown

       Low adown and around,

And I should look like a fountain of gold

       Springing alone

   With a shrill inner sound

       Over the throne

   In the midst of the hall;

Till that great sea-snake under the sea

From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps

Would slowly trail himself sevenfold

Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate

With his large calm eyes for the love of me.

And all the mermen under the sea

Would feel their immortality

Die in their hearts for the love of me.


III


But at night I would wander away, away,

   I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,

And lightly vault from the throne and play

   With the mermen in and out of the rocks;

We would run to and fro, and hide and seek,

   On the broad sea-wolds in the crimson shells,

Whose silvery spikes are nighest the sea.

But if any came near I would call and shriek,

And adown the steep like a wave I would leap

   From the diamond-ledges that jut from the dells;

For I would not be kiss'd by all who would list

Of the bold merry mermen under the sea.

They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,

In the purple twilights under the sea;

But the king of them all would carry me,

Woo me, and win me, and marry me,

In the branching jaspers under the sea.

Then all the dry-pied things that be

In the hueless mosses under the sea

Would curl round my silver feet silently,

All looking up for the love of me.

And if I should carol aloud, from aloft

All things that are forked, and horned, and soft

Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,

All looking down for the love of me.

Poem 132: The Miller's Daughter

It is the miller's daughter,

    And she is grown so dear, so dear,

That I would be the jewel

    That trembles in her ear:

For hid in ringlets day and night,

I'd touch her neck so warm and white.


And I would be the girdle

    About her dainty dainty waist,

And her heart would beat against me,

    In sorrow and in rest:

And I should know if it beat right,

I'd clasp it round so close and tight.


And I would be the necklace,

    And all day long to fall and rise

Upon her balmy bosom,

    With her laughter or her sighs:

And I would lie so light, so light,

I scarce should be unclasp'd at night.

Soberer-hued

Poem 134: The Owl

When cats run home and light is come,

    And dew is cold upon the ground,

And the far-off stream is dumb,

    And the whirring sail goes round,

    And the whirring sail goes round;

         Alone and warming his five wits,

         The white owl in the belfry sits.


When merry milkmaids click the latch,

    And rarely smells the new-mown hay,

And the cock hath sung beneath the thatch

    Twice or thrice his roundelay,

    Twice or thrice his roundelay;

         Alone and warming his five wits,

         The white owl in the belfry sits.

Poem 135: The Palace of Art

I built my soul a lordly pleasure-house,

     Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.

   I said, "O Soul, make merry and carouse,

      Dear soul, for all is well."

    A huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish'd brass

     I chose. The ranged ramparts bright

   From level meadow-bases of deep grass

      Suddenly scaled the light.

    Thereon I built it firm. Of ledge or shelf

    The rock rose clear, or winding stair.

  My soul would live alone unto herself

     In her high palace there.


   And "while the world runs round and round," I said,

    "Reign thou apart, a quiet king,

  Still as, while Saturn whirls, his steadfast shade

     Sleeps on his luminous ring."


   To which my soul made answer readily:

    "Trust me, in bliss I shall abide

  In this great mansion, that is built for me,

     So royal-rich and wide."


   Four courts I made, East, West and South and North,

    In each a squared lawn, wherefrom

  The golden gorge of dragons spouted forth

     A flood of fountain-foam.


   And round the cool green courts there ran a row

    Of cloisters, branch'd like mighty woods,

  Echoing all night to that sonorous flow

     Of spouted fountain-floods.


   And round the roofs a gilded gallery

    That lent broad verge to distant lands,

  Far as the wild swan wings, to where the sky

     Dipt down to sea and sands.


   From those four jets four currents in one swell

    Across the mountain stream'd below

  In misty folds, that floating as they fell

     Lit up a torrent-bow.


   And high on every peak a statue seem'd

    To hang on tiptoe, tossing up

  A cloud of incense of all odour steam'd

     From out a golden cup.


   So that she thought, "And who shall gaze upon

    My palace with unblinded eyes,

  While this great bow will waver in the sun,

     And that sweet incense rise?"


   For that sweet incense rose and never fail'd,

    And, while day sank or mounted higher,

  The light aërial gallery, golden-rail'd,

     Burnt like a fringe of fire.


   Likewise the deep-set windows, stain'd and traced,

    Would seem slow-flaming crimson fires

  From shadow'd grots of arches interlaced,

     And tipt with frost-like spires.


   Full of long-sounding corridors it was,

    That over-vaulted grateful gloom,

  Thro' which the livelong day my soul did pass,

     Well-pleased, from room to room.


   Full of great rooms and small the palace stood,

    All various, each a perfect whole

  From living Nature, fit for every mood

     And change of my still soul.


   For some were hung with arras green and blue,

    Showing a gaudy summer-morn,

  Where with puff'd cheek the belted hunter blew

     His wreathed bugle-horn.


   One seem'd all dark and red--a tract of sand,

    And some one pacing there alone,

  Who paced for ever in a glimmering land,

     Lit with a low large moon.


   One show'd an iron coast and angry waves.

    You seem'd to hear them climb and fall

  And roar rock-thwarted under bellowing caves,

     Beneath the windy wall.


   And one, a full-fed river winding slow

    By herds upon an endless plain,

  The ragged rims of thunder brooding low,

     With shadow-streaks of rain.


   And one, the reapers at their sultry toil.

    In front they bound the sheaves. Behind

  Were realms of upland, prodigal in oil,

     And hoary to the wind.


   And one a foreground black with stones and slags,

    Beyond, a line of heights, and higher

  All barr'd with long white cloud the scornful crags,

     And highest, snow and fire.


   And one, an English home--gray twilight pour'd

    On dewy pastures, dewy trees,

  Softer than sleep--all things in order stored,

     A haunt of ancient Peace.


   Nor these alone, but every landscape fair,

    As fit for every mood of mind,

  Or gay, or grave, or sweet, or stern, was there,

     Not less than truth design'd.


   Or the maid-mother by a crucifix,

    In tracts of pasture sunny-warm,

  Beneath branch-work of costly sardonyx

     Sat smiling, babe in arm.


   Or in a clear-wall'd city on the sea,

    Near gilded organ-pipes, her hair

  Wound with white roses, slept St. Cecily;

     An angel look'd at her.



   Or thronging all one porch of Paradise

    A group of Houris bow'd to see

  The dying Islamite, with hands and eyes

     That said, We wait for thee.



   Or mythic Uther's deeply-wounded son

    In some fair space of sloping greens

  Lay, dozing in the vale of Avalon,

     And watch'd by weeping queens.



   Or hollowing one hand against his ear,

    To list a foot-fall, ere he saw

  The wood-nymph, stay'd the Ausonian king to hear

     Of wisdom and of law.



   Or over hills with peaky tops engrail'd,

    And many a tract of palm and rice,

  The throne of Indian Cama slowly sail'd

     A summer fann'd with spice.



   Or sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasp'd,

    From off her shoulder backward borne:

  From one hand droop'd a crocus: one hand grasp'd

     The mild bull's golden horn.



   Or else flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh

    Half-buried in the Eagle's down,

  Sole as a flying star shot thro' the sky

     Above the pillar'd town.



   Nor these alone; but every legend fair

    Which the supreme Caucasian mind

  Carved out of Nature for itself, was there,

     Not less than life, design'd.



   Then in the towers I placed great bells that swung,

    Moved of themselves, with silver sound;

  And with choice paintings of wise men I hung

     The royal dais round.



   For there was Milton like a seraph strong,

    Beside him Shakespeare bland and mild;

  And there the world-worn Dante grasp'd his song,

     And somewhat grimly smiled.



   And there the Ionian father of the rest;

    A million wrinkles carved his skin;

  A hundred winters snow'd upon his breast,

     From cheek and throat and chin.



   Above, the fair hall-ceiling stately-set

    Many an arch high up did lift,

  And angels rising and descending met

     With interchange of gift.



   Below was all mosaic choicely plann'd

    With cycles of the human tale

  Of this wide world, the times of every land

     So wrought, they will not fail.



   The people here, a beast of burden slow,

    Toil'd onward, prick'd with goads and stings;

  Here play'd, a tiger, rolling to and fro

     The heads and crowns of kings;



   Here rose, an athlete, strong to break or bind

    All force in bonds that might endure,

  And here once more like some sick man declined,

     And trusted any cure.



   But over these she trod: and those great bells

    Began to chime. She took her throne:

  She sat betwixt the shining Oriels,

     To sing her songs alone.



   And thro' the topmost Oriels' coloured flame

    Two godlike faces gazed below;

  Plato the wise, and large brow'd Verulam,

     The first of those who know.



   And all those names, that in their motion were

    Full-welling fountain-heads of change,

  Betwixt the slender shafts were blazon'd fair

     In diverse raiment strange:



   Thro' which the lights, rose, amber, emerald, blue,

    Flush'd in her temples and her eyes,

  And from her lips, as morn from Memnon, drew

     Rivers of melodies.



   No nightingale delighteth to prolong

    Her low preamble all alone,

  More than my soul to hear her echo'd song

     Throb thro' the ribbed stone;



   Singing and murmuring in her feastful mirth,

    Joying to feel herself alive,

  Lord over Nature, Lord of the visible earth,

     Lord of the senses five;



   Communing with herself: "All these are mine,

    And let the world have peace or wars,

  'T is one to me." She--when young night divine

     Crown'd dying day with stars,



   Making sweet close of his delicious toils--

    Lit light in wreaths and anadems,

  And pure quintessences of precious oils

     In hollow'd moons of gems,



   To mimic heaven; and clapt her hands and cried,

    "I marvel if my still delight

  In this great house so royal-rich, and wide,

     Be flatter'd to the height.



   "O all things fair to sate my various eyes!

    O shapes and hues that please me well!

  O silent faces of the Great and Wise,

     My Gods, with whom I dwell!



   "O God-like isolation which art mine,

    I can but count thee perfect gain,

  What time I watch the darkening droves of swine

     That range on yonder plain.



   "In filthy sloughs they roll a prurient skin,

    They graze and wallow, breed and sleep;

  And oft some brainless devil enters in,

     And drives them to the deep."



   Then of the moral instinct would she prate

    And of the rising from the dead,

  As hers by right of full accomplish'd Fate;

     And at the last she said:



   "I take possession of man's mind and deed.

    I care not what the sects may brawl.

  I sit as God holding no form of creed,

     But contemplating all." *



   Full oft the riddle of the painful earth

    Flash'd thro' her as she sat alone,

  Yet not the less held she her solemn mirth,

     And intellectual throne.



   And so she throve and prosper'd; so three years

    She prosper'd: on the fourth she fell,

  Like Herod, when the shout was in his ears,

     Struck thro' with pangs of hell.



   Lest she should fail and perish utterly,

    God, before whom ever lie bare

  The abysmal deeps of Personality,

     Plagued her with sore despair.



   When she would think, where'er she turn'd her sight

    The airy hand confusion wrought,

  Wrote, "Mene, mene," and divided quite

     The kingdom of her thought.



   Deep dread and loathing of her solitude

    Fell on her, from which mood was born

  Scorn of herself; again, from out that mood

     Laughter at her self-scorn.



   "What! is not this my place of strength," she said,

    "My spacious mansion built for me,

  Whereof the strong foundation-stones were laid

     Since my first memory?"



   But in dark corners of her palace stood

    Uncertain shapes; and unawares

  On white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood,

     And horrible nightmares,



   And hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame,

    And, with dim fretted foreheads all,

  On corpses three-months-old at noon she came,

     That stood against the wall.



   A spot of dull stagnation, without light

    Or power of movement, seem'd my soul,

  'Mid onward-sloping motions infinite

     Making for one sure goal.



   A still salt pool, lock'd in with bars of sand,

    Left on the shore, that hears all night

  The plunging seas draw backward from the land

     Their moon-led waters white.



   A star that with the choral starry dance

    Join'd not, but stood, and standing saw

  The hollow orb of moving Circumstance

     Roll'd round by one fix'd law.



   Back on herself her serpent pride had curl'd.

    "No voice," she shriek'd in that lone hall,

  "No voice breaks thro' the stillness of this world:

     One deep, deep silence all!"



   She, mouldering with the dull earth's mouldering sod,

    Inwrapt tenfold in slothful shame,

  Lay there exiled from eternal God,

     Lost to her place and name;



   And death and life she hated equally,

    And nothing saw, for her despair,

  But dreadful time, dreadful eternity,

     No comfort anywhere;



   Remaining utterly confused with fears,

    And ever worse with growing time,

  And ever unrelieved by dismal tears,

     And all alone in crime:



   Shut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round

    With blackness as a solid wall,

  Far off she seem'd to hear the dully sound

     Of human footsteps fall.



   As in strange lands a traveller walking slow,

    In doubt and great perplexity,

  A little before moon-rise hears the low

     Moan of an unknown sea;



   And knows not if it be thunder, or a sound

    Of rocks thrown down, or one deep cry

  Of great wild beasts; then thinketh, "I have found

     A new land, but I die."



   She howl'd aloud, "I am on fire within.

    There comes no murmur of reply.

  What is it that will take away my sin,

     And save me lest I die?"



   So when four years were wholly finished,

    She threw her royal robes away.

  "Make me a cottage in the vale," she said,

     "Where I may mourn and pray.



   "Yet pull not down my palace towers, that are

    So lightly, beautifully built:

  Perchance I may return with others there

     When I have purged my guilt."

Poem 136: The Passing Of Arthur

That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,

First made and latest left of all the knights,

Told, when the man was no more than a voice

In the white winter of his age, to those

With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.


For on their march to westward, Bedivere,

Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,

Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:


'I found Him in the shining of the stars,

I marked Him in the flowering of His fields,

But in His ways with men I find Him not.

I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.

O me! for why is all around us here

As if some lesser god had made the world,

But had not force to shape it as he would,

Till the High God behold it from beyond,

And enter it, and make it beautiful?

Or else as if the world were wholly fair,

But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,

And have not power to see it as it is:

Perchance, because we see not to the close;--

For I, being simple, thought to work His will,

And have but stricken with the sword in vain;

And all whereon I leaned in wife and friend

Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm

Reels back into the beast, and is no more.

My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death;

Nay--God my Christ--I pass but shall not die.'


Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,

There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain killed

In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown

Along a wandering wind, and past his ear

Went shrilling, 'Hollow, hollow all delight!

Hail, King! tomorrow thou shalt pass away.

Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.

And I am blown along a wandering wind,

And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight.'

And fainter onward, like wild birds that change

Their season in the night and wail their way

From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream

Shrilled; but in going mingled with dim cries

Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,

As of some lonely city sacked by night,

When all is lost, and wife and child with wail

Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and called,

'Who spake?  A dream.  O light upon the wind,

Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries

Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild

Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?'


This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:

'O me, my King, let pass whatever will,

Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;

But in their stead thy name and glory cling

To all high places like a golden cloud

For ever:  but as yet thou shalt not pass.

Light was Gawain in life, and light in death

Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;

And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--

I hear the steps of Modred in the west,

And with him many of thy people, and knights

Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown

Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.

Right well in heart they know thee for the King.

Arise, go forth and conquer as of old.'


Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

'Far other is this battle in the west

Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,

And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,

Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,

And shook him through the north.  Ill doom is mine

To war against my people and my knights.

The king who fights his people fights himself.

And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke

That strikes them dead is as my death to me.

Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way

Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw

One lying in the dust at Almesbury,

Hath folded in the passes of the world.'


Then rose the King and moved his host by night,

And ever pushed Sir Modred, league by league,

Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--

A land of old upheaven from the abyss

By fire, to sink into the abyss again;

Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,

And the long mountains ended in a coast

Of ever-shifting sand, and far away

The phantom circle of a moaning sea.

There the pursuer could pursue no more,

And he that fled no further fly the King;

And there, that day when the great light of heaven

Burned at his lowest in the rolling year,

On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.

Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight

Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.

A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:

Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew

Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold

With formless fear; and even on Arthur fell

Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.

For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,

And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;

And some had visions out of golden youth,

And some beheld the faces of old ghosts

Look in upon the battle; and in the mist

Was many a noble deed, many a base,

And chance and craft and strength in single fights,

And ever and anon with host to host

Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,

Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash

Of battleaxes on shattered helms, and shrieks

After the Christ, of those who falling down

Looked up for heaven, and only saw the mist;

And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,

Oaths, insults, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,

Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs

In that close mist, and cryings for the light,

Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.


Last, as by some one deathbed after wail

Of suffering, silence follows, or through death

Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,

Save for some whisper of the seething seas,

A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day

Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came

A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew

The mist aside, and with that wind the tide

Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field

Of battle:  but no man was moving there;

Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,

Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave

Brake in among dead faces, to and fro

Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down

Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,

And shivered brands that once had fought with Rome,

And rolling far along the gloomy shores

The voice of days of old and days to be.


Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,

And whiter than the mist that all day long

Had held the field of battle was the King:


'Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,

And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,

And beats upon the faces of the dead,

My dead, as though they had not died for me?--

O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fallen

Confusion, till I know not what I am,

Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.

Behold, I seem but King among the dead.'


Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere:  'My King,

King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,

There also will I worship thee as King.

Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live

Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought

The heathen back among us, yonder stands,

Modred, unharmed, the traitor of thine house.'


Then spake the King:  'My house hath been my doom.

But call not thou this traitor of my house

Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.

My house are rather they who sware my vows,

Yea, even while they brake them, owned me King.

And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,

When all the purport of my throne hath failed,

That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.

King am I, whatsoever be their cry;

And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see

Yet, ere I pass.'  And uttering this the King

Made at the man:  then Modred smote his liege

Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword

Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,

Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,

Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.


So all day long the noise of battle rolled

Among the mountains by the winter sea;

Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,

Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their lord,

King Arthur.  Then, because his wound was deep,

The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,

And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,

A broken chancel with a broken cross,

That stood on a dark strait of barren land:

On one side lay the Ocean, and on one

Lay a great water, and the moon was full.


Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

'The sequel of today unsolders all

The goodliest fellowship of famous knights

Whereof this world holds record.  Such a sleep

They sleep--the men I loved.  I think that we

Shall never more, at any future time,

Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,

Walking about the gardens and the halls

Of Camelot, as in the days that were.

I perish by this people which I made,--

Though Merlin sware that I should come again

To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,

I am so deeply smitten through the helm

That without help I cannot last till morn.

Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,

Which was my pride:  for thou rememberest how

In those old days, one summer noon, an arm

Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,

Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

Holding the sword--and how I rowed across

And took it, and have worn it, like a king;

And, wheresoever I am sung or told

In aftertime, this also shall be known:

But now delay not:  take Excalibur,

And fling him far into the middle mere:

Watch what thou se'st, and lightly bring me word.'


To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:

'It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,

Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm--

A little thing may harm a wounded man;

Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,

Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.'


So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept,

And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,

Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,

Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang

Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down

By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,

Came on the shining levels of the lake.


There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,

And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,

Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth

And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:

For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,

Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work

Of subtlest jewellery.  He gazed so long

That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,

This way and that dividing the swift mind,

In act to throw:  but at the last it seemed

Better to leave Excalibur concealed

There in the many-knotted waterflags,

That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.

So strode he back slow to the wounded King.


Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

'Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?

What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'


And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

'I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,

And the wild water lapping on the crag.'


To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:

'Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,

Not rendering true answer, as beseemed

Thy falty, nor like a noble knight:

For surer sign had followed, either hand,

Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.

This is a shameful thing for men to lie.

Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,

As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing

I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.'


Then went Sir Bedivere the second time

Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,

Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;

But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,

How curiously and strangely chased, he smote

His palms together, and he cried aloud:


'And if indeed I cast the brand away,

Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,

Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,

Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.

What good should follow this, if this were done?

What harm, undone?  Deep harm to disobey,

Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.

Were it well to obey then, if a king demand

An act unprofitable, against himself?

The King is sick, and knows not what he does.

What record, or what relic of my lord

Should be to aftertime, but empty breath

And rumours of a doubt?  But were this kept,

Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,

Some one might show it at a joust of arms,

Saying, "King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,

Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.

Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps

Upon the hidden bases of the hills."

So might some old man speak in the aftertime

To all the people, winning reverence.

But now much honour and much fame were lost.'


So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,

And hid Excalibur the second time,

And so strode back slow to the wounded King.


Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:

'What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'


And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

'I heard the water lapping on the crag,

And the long ripple washing in the reeds.'


To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:

'Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,

Unknightly, traitor-hearted!  Woe is me!

Authority forgets a dying king,

Laid widowed of the power in his eye

That bowed the will.  I see thee what thou art,

For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,

In whom should meet the offices of all,

Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;

Either from lust of gold, or like a girl

Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.

Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,

And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:

But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,

I will arise and slay thee with my hands.'


Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,

And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged

Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,

And strongly wheeled and threw it.  The great brand

Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,

And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,

Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,

Seen where the moving isles of winter shock

By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.

So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:

But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm

Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him

Three times, and drew him under in the mere.

And lightly went the other to the King.


Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:

'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.

Speak out:  what is it thou hast heard, or seen?'


And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

'Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems

Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,

Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,

Not though I live three lives of mortal men,

So great a miracle as yonder hilt.

Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;

But when I looked again, behold an arm,

Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,

That caught him by the hilt, and brandished him

Three times, and drew him under in the mere.'


And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:

'My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.

Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,

And bear me to the margin; yet I fear

My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.'


So saying, from the pavement he half rose,

Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,

And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes

As in a picture.  Him Sir Bedivere

Remorsefully regarded through his tears,

And would have spoken, but he found not words;

Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,

O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,

And rising bore him through the place of tombs.


But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,

Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed

When all the house is mute.  So sighed the King,

Muttering and murmuring at his ear, 'Quick, quick!

I fear it is too late, and I shall die.'


But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,

Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,

Larger than human on the frozen hills.

He heard the deep behind him, and a cry

Before.  His own thought drove him like a goad.

Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves

And barren chasms, and all to left and right

The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based

His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang

Sharp-smitten with the dint of armd heels--

And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,

And the long glories of the winter moon.


Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,

Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,

Beneath them; and descending they were ware

That all the decks were dense with stately forms,

Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these

Three Queens with crowns of gold:  and from them rose

A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,

And, as it were one voice, an agony

Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills

All night in a waste land, where no one comes,

Or hath come, since the making of the world.


Then murmured Arthur, 'Place me in the barge.'

So to the barge they came.  There those three Queens

Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.

But she, that rose the tallest of them all

And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,

And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,

And called him by his name, complaining loud,

And dropping bitter tears against a brow

Striped with dark blood:  for all his face was white

And colourless, and like the withered moon

Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;

And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops

Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--

That made his forehead like a rising sun

High from the das-throne--were parched with dust;

Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,

Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.

So like a shattered column lay the King;

Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,

From spur to plume a star of tournament,

Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged

Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.


Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:

'Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?

Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?

For now I see the true old times are dead,

When every morning brought a noble chance,

And every chance brought out a noble knight.

Such times have been not since the light that led

The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.

But now the whole Round Table is dissolved

Which was an image of the mighty world,

And I, the last, go forth companionless,

And the days darken round me, and the years,

Among new men, strange faces, other minds.'


And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:

'The old order changeth, yielding place to new,

And God fulfils himself in many ways,

Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.

Comfort thyself:  what comfort is in me?

I have lived my life, and that which I have done

May He within himself make pure! but thou,

If thou shouldst never see my face again,

Pray for my soul.  More things are wrought by prayer

Than this world dreams of.  Wherefore, let thy voice

Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

For what are men better than sheep or goats

That nourish a blind life within the brain,

If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer

Both for themselves and those who call them friend?

For so the whole round earth is every way

Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

But now farewell.  I am going a long way

With these thou se'st--if indeed I go

(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--

To the island-valley of Avilion;

Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,

Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies

Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns

And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,

Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.'


So said he, and the barge with oar and sail

Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan

That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,

Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood

With swarthy webs.  Long stood Sir Bedivere

Revolving many memories, till the hull

Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,

And on the mere the wailing died away.


But when that moan had past for evermore,

The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn

Amazed him, and he groaned, 'The King is gone.'

And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,

'From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'


Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb

The last hard footstep of that iron crag;

Thence marked the black hull moving yet, and cried,

'He passes to be King among the dead,

And after healing of his grievous wound

He comes again; but--if he come no more--

O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,

Who shrieked and wailed, the three whereat we gazed

On that high day, when, clothed with living light,

They stood before his throne in silence, friends

Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?'


Then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint

As from beyond the limit of the world,

Like the last echo born of a great cry,

Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice

Around a king returning from his wars.


Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb

Even to the highest he could climb, and saw,

Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,

Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,

Down that long water opening on the deep

Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go

From less to less and vanish into light.

And the new sun rose bringing the new year.

Poem 137: The Princess (part 2)

At break of day the College Portress came:

She brought us Academic silks, in hue

The lilac, with a silken hood to each,

And zoned with gold; and now when these were on,

And we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,

She, curtseying her obeisance, let us know

The Princess Ida waited:  out we paced,

I first, and following through the porch that sang

All round with laurel, issued in a court

Compact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths

Of classic frieze, with ample awnings gay

Betwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.

The Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,

Enringed a billowing fountain in the midst;

And here and there on lattice edges lay

Or book or lute; but hastily we past,

And up a flight of stairs into the hall.


There at a board by tome and paper sat,

With two tame leopards couched beside her throne,

All beauty compassed in a female form,

The Princess; liker to the inhabitant

Of some clear planet close upon the Sun,

Than our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,

And so much grace and power, breathing down

From over her arched brows, with every turn

Lived through her to the tips of her long hands,

And to her feet.  She rose her height, and said:


'We give you welcome:  not without redound

Of use and glory to yourselves ye come,

The first-fruits of the stranger:  aftertime,

And that full voice which circles round the grave,

Will rank you nobly, mingled up with me.

What! are the ladies of your land so tall?'

'We of the court' said Cyril.  'From the court'

She answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:

'The climax of his age! as though there were

One rose in all the world, your Highness that,

He worships your ideal:'  she replied:

'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear

This barren verbiage, current among men,

Light coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.

Your flight from out your bookless wilds would seem

As arguing love of knowledge and of power;

Your language proves you still the child.  Indeed,

We dream not of him:  when we set our hand

To this great work, we purposed with ourself

Never to wed.  You likewise will do well,

Ladies, in entering here, to cast and fling

The tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,

Some future time, if so indeed you will,

You may with those self-styled our lords ally

Your fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'


At those high words, we conscious of ourselves,

Perused the matting:  then an officer

Rose up, and read the statutes, such as these:

Not for three years to correspond with home;

Not for three years to cross the liberties;

Not for three years to speak with any men;

And many more, which hastily subscribed,

We entered on the boards:  and 'Now,' she cried,

'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not.  Look, our hall!

Our statues!--not of those that men desire,

Sleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,

Nor stunted squaws of West or East; but she

That taught the Sabine how to rule, and she

The foundress of the Babylonian wall,

The Carian Artemisia strong in war,

The Rhodope, that built the pyramid,

Clelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene

That fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows

Of Agrippina.  Dwell with these, and lose

Convention, since to look on noble forms

Makes noble through the sensuous organism

That which is higher.  O lift your natures up:

Embrace our aims:  work out your freedom.  Girls,

Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:

Drink deep, until the habits of the slave,

The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite

And slander, die.  Better not be at all

Than not be noble.  Leave us:  you may go:

Today the Lady Psyche will harangue

The fresh arrivals of the week before;

For they press in from all the provinces,

And fill the hive.'

                  She spoke, and bowing waved

Dismissal:  back again we crost the court

To Lady Psyche's:  as we entered in,

There sat along the forms, like morning doves

That sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,

A patient range of pupils; she herself

Erect behind a desk of satin-wood,

A quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,

And on the hither side, or so she looked,

Of twenty summers.  At her left, a child,

In shining draperies, headed like a star,

Her maiden babe, a double April old,

Aglaïa slept.  We sat:  the Lady glanced:

Then Florian, but not livelier than the dame

That whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,

'My sister.'  'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'

Said Cyril.  'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.


'This world was once a fluid haze of light,

Till toward the centre set the starry tides,

And eddied into suns, that wheeling cast

The planets:  then the monster, then the man;

Tattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,

Raw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;

As yet we find in barbarous isles, and here

Among the lowest.'

                 Thereupon she took

A bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;

Glanced at the legendary Amazon

As emblematic of a nobler age;

Appraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those

That lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;

Ran down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines

Of empire, and the woman's state in each,

How far from just; till warming with her theme

She fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique

And little-footed China, touched on Mahomet

With much contempt, and came to chivalry:

When some respect, however slight, was paid

To woman, superstition all awry:

However then commenced the dawn:  a beam

Had slanted forward, falling in a land

Of promise; fruit would follow.  Deep, indeed,

Their debt of thanks to her who first had dared

To leap the rotten pales of prejudice,

Disyoke their necks from custom, and assert

None lordlier than themselves but that which made

Woman and man.  She had founded; they must build.

Here might they learn whatever men were taught:

Let them not fear:  some said their heads were less:

Some men's were small; not they the least of men;

For often fineness compensated size:

Besides the brain was like the hand, and grew

With using; thence the man's, if more was more;

He took advantage of his strength to be

First in the field:  some ages had been lost;

But woman ripened earlier, and her life

Was longer; and albeit their glorious names

Were fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth

The highest is the measure of the man,

And not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,

Nor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,

But Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so

With woman:  and in arts of government

Elizabeth and others; arts of war

The peasant Joan and others; arts of grace

Sappho and others vied with any man:

And, last not least, she who had left her place,

And bowed her state to them, that they might grow

To use and power on this Oasis, lapt

In the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight

Of ancient influence and scorn.

                              At last

She rose upon a wind of prophecy

Dilating on the future; 'everywhere

Who heads in council, two beside the hearth,

Two in the tangled business of the world,

Two in the liberal offices of life,

Two plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss

Of science, and the secrets of the mind:

Musician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:

And everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth

Should bear a double growth of those rare souls,

Poets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'


She ended here, and beckoned us:  the rest

Parted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she

Began to address us, and was moving on

In gratulation, till as when a boat

Tacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice

Faltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried

'My brother!'  'Well, my sister.'  'O,' she said,

'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?

Why who are these? a wolf within the fold!

A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!

A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'

'No plot, no plot,' he answered.  'Wretched boy,

How saw you not the inscription on the gate,

LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'

'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think

The softer Adams of your Academe,

O sister, Sirens though they be, were such

As chanted on the blanching bones of men?'

'But you will find it otherwise' she said.

'You jest:  ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow

Binds me to speak, and O that iron will,

That axelike edge unturnable, our Head,

The Princess.'  'Well then, Psyche, take my life,

And nail me like a weasel on a grange

For warning:  bury me beside the gate,

And cut this epitaph above my bones;

~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,

All for the common good of womankind.~'

'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen

And heard the Lady Psyche.'

                          I struck in:

'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;

Receive it; and in me behold the Prince

Your countryman, affianced years ago

To the Lady Ida:  here, for here she was,

And thus (what other way was left) I came.'

'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;

If any, this; but none.  Whate'er I was

Disrooted, what I am is grafted here.

Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe

Within this vestal limit, and how should I,

Who am not mine, say, live:  the thunderbolt

Hangs silent; but prepare:  I speak; it falls.'

'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,

I think no more of deadly lurks therein,

Than in a clapper clapping in a garth,

To scare the fowl from fruit:  if more there be,

If more and acted on, what follows? war;

Your own work marred:  for this your Academe,

Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo

Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass

With all fair theories only made to gild

A stormless summer.'  'Let the Princess judge

Of that' she said:  'farewell, Sir--and to you.

I shudder at the sequel, but I go.'


'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,

'The fifth in line from that old Florian,

Yet hangs his portrait in my father's hall

(The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow

Sun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)

As he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,

And all else fled? we point to it, and we say,

The loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,

But branches current yet in kindred veins.'

'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she

With whom I sang about the morning hills,

Flung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,

And snared the squirrel of the glen? are you

That Psyche, wont to bind my throbbing brow,

To smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught

Of fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read

My sickness down to happy dreams? are you

That brother-sister Psyche, both in one?

You were that Psyche, but what are you now?'

'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom

I would be that for ever which I seem,

Woman, if I might sit beside your feet,

And glean your scattered sapience.'

                                  Then once more,

'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,

'That on her bridal morn before she past

From all her old companions, when the kind

Kissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties

Would still be dear beyond the southern hills;

That were there any of our people there

In want or peril, there was one to hear

And help them? look! for such are these and I.'

'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,

In gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn

Came flying while you sat beside the well?

The creature laid his muzzle on your lap,

And sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood

Was sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.

That was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.

O by the bright head of my little niece,

You were that Psyche, and what are you now?'

'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,

'The mother of the sweetest little maid,

That ever crowed for kisses.'

                            'Out upon it!'

She answered, 'peace! and why should I not play

The Spartan Mother with emotion, be

The Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?

Him you call great:  he for the common weal,

The fading politics of mortal Rome,

As I might slay this child, if good need were,

Slew both his sons:  and I, shall I, on whom

The secular emancipation turns

Of half this world, be swerved from right to save

A prince, a brother? a little will I yield.

Best so, perchance, for us, and well for you.

O hard, when love and duty clash!  I fear

My conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--

Hear my conditions:  promise (otherwise

You perish) as you came, to slip away

Today, tomorrow, soon:  it shall be said,

These women were too barbarous, would not learn;

They fled, who might have shamed us:  promise, all.'


What could we else, we promised each; and she,

Like some wild creature newly-caged, commenced

A to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused

By Florian; holding out her lily arms

Took both his hands, and smiling faintly said:

'I knew you at the first:  though you have grown

You scarce have altered:  I am sad and glad

To see you, Florian.  ~I~ give thee to death

My brother! it was duty spoke, not I.

My needful seeming harshness, pardon it.

Our mother, is she well?'

                        With that she kissed

His forehead, then, a moment after, clung

About him, and betwixt them blossomed up

From out a common vein of memory

Sweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,

And far allusion, till the gracious dews

Began to glisten and to fall:  and while

They stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,

'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.'

Back started she, and turning round we saw

The Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,

Melissa, with her hand upon the lock,

A rosy blonde, and in a college gown,

That clad her like an April daffodilly

(Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,

And all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,

As bottom agates seen to wave and float

In crystal currents of clear morning seas.


So stood that same fair creature at the door.

Then Lady Psyche, 'Ah--Melissa--you!

You heard us?' and Melissa, 'O pardon me

I heard, I could not help it, did not wish:

But, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,

Nor think I bear that heart within my breast,

To give three gallant gentlemen to death.'

'I trust you,' said the other, 'for we two

Were always friends, none closer, elm and vine:

But yet your mother's jealous temperament--

Let not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove

The Danaïd of a leaky vase, for fear

This whole foundation ruin, and I lose

My honour, these their lives.'  'Ah, fear me not'

Replied Melissa; 'no--I would not tell,

No, not for all Aspasia's cleverness,

No, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things

That Sheba came to ask of Solomon.'

'Be it so' the other, 'that we still may lead

The new light up, and culminate in peace,

For Solomon may come to Sheba yet.'

Said Cyril, 'Madam, he the wisest man

Feasted the woman wisest then, in halls

Of Lebanonian cedar:  nor should you

(Though, Madam, ~you~ should answer, ~we~ would ask)

Less welcome find among us, if you came

Among us, debtors for our lives to you,

Myself for something more.'  He said not what,

But 'Thanks,' she answered 'Go:  we have been too long

Together:  keep your hoods about the face;

They do so that affect abstraction here.

Speak little; mix not with the rest; and hold

Your promise:  all, I trust, may yet be well.'


We turned to go, but Cyril took the child,

And held her round the knees against his waist,

And blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,

While Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child

Pushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;

And thus our conference closed.

                              And then we strolled

For half the day through stately theatres

Benched crescent-wise.  In each we sat, we heard

The grave Professor.  On the lecture slate

The circle rounded under female hands

With flawless demonstration:  followed then

A classic lecture, rich in sentiment,

With scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out

By violet-hooded Doctors, elegies

And quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long

That on the stretched forefinger of all Time

Sparkle for ever:  then we dipt in all

That treats of whatsoever is, the state,

The total chronicles of man, the mind,

The morals, something of the frame, the rock,

The star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,

Electric, chemic laws, and all the rest,

And whatsoever can be taught and known;

Till like three horses that have broken fence,

And glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,

We issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:

'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.'

'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well;

But when did woman ever yet invent?'

'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt

No more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked

The trash that made me sick, and almost sad?'

'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it.

Should I not call her wise, who made me wise?

And learnt?  I learnt more from her in a flash,

Than in my brainpan were an empty hull,

And every Muse tumbled a science in.

A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,

And round these halls a thousand baby loves

Fly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,

Whence follows many a vacant pang; but O

With me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,

The Head of all the golden-shafted firm,

The long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;

He cleft me through the stomacher; and now

What think you of it, Florian? do I chase

The substance or the shadow? will it hold?

I have no sorcerer's malison on me,

No ghostly hauntings like his Highness.  I

Flatter myself that always everywhere

I know the substance when I see it.  Well,

Are castles shadows?  Three of them?  Is she

The sweet proprietress a shadow?  If not,

Shall those three castles patch my tattered coat?

For dear are those three castles to my wants,

And dear is sister Psyche to my heart,

And two dear things are one of double worth,

And much I might have said, but that my zone

Unmanned me:  then the Doctors!  O to hear

The Doctors!  O to watch the thirsty plants

Imbibing! once or twice I thought to roar,

To break my chain, to shake my mane:  but thou,

Modulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry!

Make liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat;

Abase those eyes that ever loved to meet

Star-sisters answering under crescent brows;

Abate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose

A flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek,

Where they like swallows coming out of time

Will wonder why they came:  but hark the bell

For dinner, let us go!'

                      And in we streamed

Among the columns, pacing staid and still

By twos and threes, till all from end to end

With beauties every shade of brown and fair

In colours gayer than the morning mist,

The long hall glittered like a bed of flowers.

How might a man not wander from his wits

Pierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own

Intent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams,

The second-sight of some Astræan age,

Sat compassed with professors:  they, the while,

Discussed a doubt and tost it to and fro:

A clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms

Of art and science:  Lady Blanche alone

Of faded form and haughtiest lineaments,

With all her autumn tresses falsely brown,

Shot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat

In act to spring.

                At last a solemn grace

Concluded, and we sought the gardens:  there

One walked reciting by herself, and one

In this hand held a volume as to read,

And smoothed a petted peacock down with that:

Some to a low song oared a shallop by,

Or under arches of the marble bridge

Hung, shadowed from the heat:  some hid and sought

In the orange thickets:  others tost a ball

Above the fountain-jets, and back again

With laughter:  others lay about the lawns,

Of the older sort, and murmured that their May

Was passing:  what was learning unto them?

They wished to marry; they could rule a house;

Men hated learned women:  but we three

Sat muffled like the Fates; and often came

Melissa hitting all we saw with shafts

Of gentle satire, kin to charity,

That harmed not:  then day droopt; the chapel bells

Called us:  we left the walks; we mixt with those

Six hundred maidens clad in purest white,

Before two streams of light from wall to wall,

While the great organ almost burst his pipes,

Groaning for power, and rolling through the court

A long melodious thunder to the sound

Of solemn psalms, and silver litanies,

The work of Ida, to call down from Heaven

A blessing on her labours for the world.



Sweet and low, sweet and low,

  Wind of the western sea,

Low, low, breathe and blow,

  Wind of the western sea!

Over the rolling waters go,

Come from the dying moon, and blow,

  Blow him again to me;

While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.


Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,

  Father will come to thee soon;

Rest, rest, on mother's breast,

  Father will come to thee soon;

Father will come to his babe in the nest,

Silver sails all out of the west

  Under the silver moon:

Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

Poem 138: The Princess (part 3)

Morn in the wake of the morning star

Came furrowing all the orient into gold.

We rose, and each by other drest with care

Descended to the court that lay three parts

In shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched

Above the darkness from their native East.


There while we stood beside the fount, and watched

Or seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached

Melissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,

Or grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes

The circled Iris of a night of tears;

'And fly,' she cried, 'O fly, while yet you may!

My mother knows:'  and when I asked her 'how,'

'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;

Yet mine in part.  O hear me, pardon me.

My mother, 'tis her wont from night to night

To rail at Lady Psyche and her side.

She says the Princess should have been the Head,

Herself and Lady Psyche the two arms;

And so it was agreed when first they came;

But Lady Psyche was the right hand now,

And the left, or not, or seldom used;

Hers more than half the students, all the love.

And so last night she fell to canvass you:

~Her~ countrywomen! she did not envy her.

"Who ever saw such wild barbarians?

Girls?--more like men!" and at these words the snake,

My secret, seemed to stir within my breast;

And oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek

Began to burn and burn, and her lynx eye

To fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:

"O marvellously modest maiden, you!

Men! girls, like men! why, if they had been men

You need not set your thoughts in rubric thus

For wholesale comment."  Pardon, I am shamed

That I must needs repeat for my excuse

What looks so little graceful:  "men" (for still

My mother went revolving on the word)

"And so they are,--very like men indeed--

And with that woman closeted for hours!"

Then came these dreadful words out one by one,

"Why--these--~are~--men:"  I shuddered:  "and you know it."

"O ask me nothing," I said:  "And she knows too,

And she conceals it."  So my mother clutched

The truth at once, but with no word from me;

And now thus early risen she goes to inform

The Princess:  Lady Psyche will be crushed;

But you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;

But heal me with your pardon ere you go.'


'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'

Said Cyril:  'Pale one, blush again:  than wear

Those lilies, better blush our lives away.

Yet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'

He added, 'lest some classic Angel speak

In scorn of us, "They mounted, Ganymedes,

To tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn."

But I will melt this marble into wax

To yield us farther furlough:'  and he went.


Melissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought

He scarce would prosper.  'Tell us,' Florian asked,

'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'

'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two

Division smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,

Too jealous, often fretful as the wind

Pent in a crevice:  much I bear with her:

I never knew my father, but she says

(God help her) she was wedded to a fool;

And still she railed against the state of things.

She had the care of Lady Ida's youth,

And from the Queen's decease she brought her up.

But when your sister came she won the heart

Of Ida:  they were still together, grew

(For so they said themselves) inosculated;

Consonant chords that shiver to one note;

One mind in all things:  yet my mother still

Affirms your Psyche thieved her theories,

And angled with them for her pupil's love:

She calls her plagiarist; I know not what:

But I must go:  I dare not tarry,' and light,

As flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.


Then murmured Florian gazing after her,

'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.

If I could love, why this were she:  how pretty

Her blushing was, and how she blushed again,

As if to close with Cyril's random wish:

Not like your Princess crammed with erring pride,

Nor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'


'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,

The dove may murmur of the dove, but I

An eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.

My princess, O my princess! true she errs,

But in her own grand way:  being herself

Three times more noble than three score of men,

She sees herself in every woman else,

And so she wears her error like a crown

To blind the truth and me:  for her, and her,

Hebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix

The nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves

The Samian Herè rises and she speaks

A Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'


So saying from the court we paced, and gained

The terrace ranged along the Northern front,

And leaning there on those balusters, high

Above the empurpled champaign, drank the gale

That blown about the foliage underneath,

And sated with the innumerable rose,

Beat balm upon our eyelids.  Hither came

Cyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;

'No fighting shadows here!  I forced a way

Through opposition crabbed and gnarled.

Better to clear prime forests, heave and thump

A league of street in summer solstice down,

Than hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.

I knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there

At point to move, and settled in her eyes

The green malignant light of coming storm.

Sir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,

As man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed

Concealment:  she demanded who we were,

And why we came?  I fabled nothing fair,

But, your example pilot, told her all.

Up went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.

But when I dwelt upon your old affiance,

She answered sharply that I talked astray.

I urged the fierce inscription on the gate,

And our three lives.  True--we had limed ourselves

With open eyes, and we must take the chance.

But such extremes, I told her, well might harm

The woman's cause.  "Not more than now," she said,

"So puddled as it is with favouritism."

I tried the mother's heart.  Shame might befall

Melissa, knowing, saying not she knew:

Her answer was "Leave me to deal with that."

I spoke of war to come and many deaths,

And she replied, her duty was to speak,

And duty duty, clear of consequences.

I grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew

No rock so hard but that a little wave

May beat admission in a thousand years,

I recommenced; "Decide not ere you pause.

I find you here but in the second place,

Some say the third--the authentic foundress you.

I offer boldly:  we will seat you highest:

Wink at our advent:  help my prince to gain

His rightful bride, and here I promise you

Some palace in our land, where you shall reign

The head and heart of all our fair she-world,

And your great name flow on with broadening time

For ever."  Well, she balanced this a little,

And told me she would answer us today,

meantime be mute:  thus much, nor more I gained.'


He ceasing, came a message from the Head.

'That afternoon the Princess rode to take

The dip of certain strata to the North.

Would we go with her? we should find the land

Worth seeing; and the river made a fall

Out yonder:'  then she pointed on to where

A double hill ran up his furrowy forks

Beyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.


Agreed to, this, the day fled on through all

Its range of duties to the appointed hour.

Then summoned to the porch we went.  She stood

Among her maidens, higher by the head,

Her back against a pillar, her foot on one

Of those tame leopards.  Kittenlike he rolled

And pawed about her sandal.  I drew near;

I gazed.  On a sudden my strange seizure came

Upon me, the weird vision of our house:

The Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,

Her gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,

Her college and her maidens, empty masks,

And I myself the shadow of a dream,

For all things were and were not.  Yet I felt

My heart beat thick with passion and with awe;

Then from my breast the involuntary sigh

Brake, as she smote me with the light of eyes

That lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook

My pulses, till to horse we got, and so

Went forth in long retinue following up

The river as it narrowed to the hills.


I rode beside her and to me she said:

'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not

Too harsh to your companion yestermorn;

Unwillingly we spake.'  'No--not to her,'

I answered, 'but to one of whom we spake

Your Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'

'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses

From him to me? we give you, being strange,

A license:  speak, and let the topic die.'


I stammered that I knew him--could have wished--

'Our king expects--was there no precontract?

There is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem

All he prefigured, and he could not see

The bird of passage flying south but longed

To follow:  surely, if your Highness keep

Your purport, you will shock him even to death,

Or baser courses, children of despair.'


'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?

Quoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that

Which men delight in, martial exercise?

To nurse a blind ideal like a girl,

Methinks he seems no better than a girl;

As girls were once, as we ourself have been:

We had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:

We touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,

Being other--since we learnt our meaning here,

To lift the woman's fallen divinity

Upon an even pedestal with man.'


She paused, and added with a haughtier smile

'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,

At no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,

O Vashti, noble Vashti!  Summoned out

She kept her state, and left the drunken king

To brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'


'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,

'On that which leans to you.  I know the Prince,

I prize his truth:  and then how vast a work

To assail this gray preëminence of man!

You grant me license; might I use it? think;

Ere half be done perchance your life may fail;

Then comes the feebler heiress of your plan,

And takes and ruins all; and thus your pains

May only make that footprint upon sand

Which old-recurring waves of prejudice

Resmooth to nothing:  might I dread that you,

With only Fame for spouse and your great deeds

For issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,

Meanwhile, what every woman counts her due,

Love, children, happiness?'

                          And she exclaimed,

'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!

What! though your Prince's love were like a God's,

Have we not made ourself the sacrifice?

You are bold indeed:  we are not talked to thus:

Yet will we say for children, would they grew

Like field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:

But children die; and let me tell you, girl,

Howe'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;

They with the sun and moon renew their light

For ever, blessing those that look on them.

Children--that men may pluck them from our hearts,

Kill us with pity, break us with ourselves--

O--children--there is nothing upon earth

More miserable than she that has a son

And sees him err:  nor would we work for fame;

Though she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,

Who earns the one POU STO whence after-hands

May move the world, though she herself effect

But little:  wherefore up and act, nor shrink

For fear our solid aim be dissipated

By frail successors.  Would, indeed, we had been,

In lieu of many mortal flies, a race

Of giants living, each, a thousand years,

That we might see our own work out, and watch

The sandy footprint harden into stone.'


I answered nothing, doubtful in myself

If that strange Poet-princess with her grand

Imaginations might at all be won.

And she broke out interpreting my thoughts:


'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;

We are used to that:  for women, up till this

Cramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,

Dwarfs of the gynæceum, fail so far

In high desire, they know not, cannot guess

How much their welfare is a passion to us.

If we could give them surer, quicker proof--

Oh if our end were less achievable

By slow approaches, than by single act

Of immolation, any phase of death,

We were as prompt to spring against the pikes,

Or down the fiery gulf as talk of it,

To compass our dear sisters' liberties.'


She bowed as if to veil a noble tear;

And up we came to where the river sloped

To plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks

A breadth of thunder.  O'er it shook the woods,

And danced the colour, and, below, stuck out

The bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared

Before man was.  She gazed awhile and said,

'As these rude bones to us, are we to her

That will be.'  'Dare we dream of that,' I asked,

'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,

That practice betters?'  'How,' she cried, 'you love

The metaphysics! read and earn our prize,

A golden brooch:  beneath an emerald plane

Sits Diotima, teaching him that died

Of hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;

She rapt upon her subject, he on her:

For there are schools for all.'  'And yet' I said

'Methinks I have not found among them all

One anatomic.'  'Nay, we thought of that,'

She answered, 'but it pleased us not:  in truth

We shudder but to dream our maids should ape

Those monstrous males that carve the living hound,

And cram him with the fragments of the grave,

Or in the dark dissolving human heart,

And holy secrets of this microcosm,

Dabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,

Encarnalize their spirits:  yet we know

Knowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:

Howbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,

Nor willing men should come among us, learnt,

For many weary moons before we came,

This craft of healing.  Were you sick, ourself

Would tend upon you.  To your question now,

Which touches on the workman and his work.

Let there be light and there was light:  'tis so:

For was, and is, and will be, are but is;

And all creation is one act at once,

The birth of light:  but we that are not all,

As parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,

And live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make

One act a phantom of succession:  thus

Our weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;

But in the shadow will we work, and mould

The woman to the fuller day.'

                            She spake

With kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,

And, o'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came

On flowery levels underneath the crag,

Full of all beauty.  'O how sweet' I said

(For I was half-oblivious of my mask)

'To linger here with one that loved us.'  'Yea,'

She answered, 'or with fair philosophies

That lift the fancy; for indeed these fields

Are lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,

Where paced the Demigods of old, and saw

The soft white vapour streak the crownèd towers

Built to the Sun:'  then, turning to her maids,

'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;

Lay out the viands.'  At the word, they raised

A tent of satin, elaborately wrought

With fair Corinna's triumph; here she stood,

Engirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,

The woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there

The bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,

And all the men mourned at his side:  but we

Set forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept

With Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I

With mine affianced.  Many a little hand

Glanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,

Many a light foot shone like a jewel set

In the dark crag:  and then we turned, we wound

About the cliffs, the copses, out and in,

Hammering and clinking, chattering stony names

Of shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,

Amygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun

Grew broader toward his death and fell, and all

The rosy heights came out above the lawns.



  The splendour falls on castle walls

     And snowy summits old in story:

  The long light shakes across the lakes,

     And the wild cataract leaps in glory.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.


  O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,

     And thinner, clearer, farther going!

  O sweet and far from cliff and scar

     The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!

Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.


  O love, they die in yon rich sky,

     They faint on hill or field or river:

  Our echoes roll from soul to soul,

     And grow for ever and for ever.

Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,

And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

Poem 139: The Princess (part 4)

'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,

If that hypothesis of theirs be sound'

Said Ida; 'let us down and rest;' and we

Down from the lean and wrinkled precipices,

By every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,

Dropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below

No bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent

Lamp-lit from the inner.  Once she leaned on me,

Descending; once or twice she lent her hand,

And blissful palpitations in the blood,

Stirring a sudden transport rose and fell.


But when we planted level feet, and dipt

Beneath the satin dome and entered in,

There leaning deep in broidered down we sank

Our elbows:  on a tripod in the midst

A fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed

Fruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.


Then she, 'Let some one sing to us:  lightlier move

The minutes fledged with music:' and a maid,

Of those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.



  'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,

Tears from the depth of some divine despair

Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,

In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,

And thinking of the days that are no more.


  'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,

That brings our friends up from the underworld,

Sad as the last which reddens over one

That sinks with all we love below the verge;

So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.


  'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns

The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds

To dying ears, when unto dying eyes

The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;

So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.


  'Dear as remembered kisses after death,

And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned

On lips that are for others; deep as love,

Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;

O Death in Life, the days that are no more.'



She ended with such passion that the tear,

She sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl

Lost in her bosom:  but with some disdain

Answered the Princess, 'If indeed there haunt

About the mouldered lodges of the Past

So sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,

Well needs it we should cram our ears with wool

And so pace by:  but thine are fancies hatched

In silken-folded idleness; nor is it

Wiser to weep a true occasion lost,

But trim our sails, and let old bygones be,

While down the streams that float us each and all

To the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,

Throne after throne, and molten on the waste

Becomes a cloud:  for all things serve their time

Toward that great year of equal mights and rights,

Nor would I fight with iron laws, in the end

Found golden:  let the past be past; let be

Their cancelled Babels:  though the rough kex break

The starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat

Hang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split

Their monstrous idols, care not while we hear

A trumpet in the distance pealing news

Of better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns

Above the unrisen morrow:' then to me;

'Know you no song of your own land,' she said,

'Not such as moans about the retrospect,

But deals with the other distance and the hues

Of promise; not a death's-head at the wine.'


Then I remembered one myself had made,

What time I watched the swallow winging south

From mine own land, part made long since, and part

Now while I sang, and maidenlike as far

As I could ape their treble, did I sing.



  'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,

Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,

And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.


  'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,

That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,

And dark and true and tender is the North.


  'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light

Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,

And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.


  'O were I thou that she might take me in,

And lay me on her bosom, and her heart

Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.


  'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,

Delaying as the tender ash delays

To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?


  'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:

Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,

But in the North long since my nest is made.


  'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,

And brief the sun of summer in the North,

And brief the moon of beauty in the South.


  'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,

Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,

And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.'



I ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,

Like the Ithacensian suitors in old time,

Stared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,

And knew not what they meant; for still my voice

Rang false:  but smiling 'Not for thee,' she said,

O Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan

Shall burst her veil:  marsh-divers, rather, maid,

Shall croak thee sister, or the meadow-creak

Grate her harsh kindred in the grass:  and this

A mere love-poem!  O for such, my friend,

We hold them slight:  they mind us of the time

When we made bricks in Egypt.  Knaves are men,

That lute and flute fantastic tenderness,

And dress the victim to the offering up,

And paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,

And play the slave to gain the tyranny.

Poor soul!  I had a maid of honour once;

She wept her true eyes blind for such a one,

A rogue of canzonets and serenades.

I loved her.  Peace be with her.  She is dead.

So they blaspheme the muse!  But great is song

Used to great ends:  ourself have often tried

Valkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed

The passion of the prophetess; for song

Is duer unto freedom, force and growth

Of spirit than to junketing and love.

Love is it?  Would this same mock-love, and this

Mock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,

Till all men grew to rate us at our worth,

Not vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes

To be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered

Whole in ourselves and owed to none.  Enough!

But now to leaven play with profit, you,

Know you no song, the true growth of your soil,

That gives the manners of your country-women?'


She spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes

Of shining expectation fixt on mine.

Then while I dragged my brains for such a song,

Cyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,

Or mastered by the sense of sport, began

To troll a careless, careless tavern-catch

Of Moll and Meg, and strange experiences

Unmeet for ladies.  Florian nodded at him,

I frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;

The lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;

'Forbear,' the Princess cried; 'Forbear, Sir' I;

And heated through and through with wrath and love,

I smote him on the breast; he started up;

There rose a shriek as of a city sacked;

Melissa clamoured 'Flee the death;' 'To horse'

Said Ida; 'home! to horse!' and fled, as flies

A troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,

When some one batters at the dovecote-doors,

Disorderly the women.  Alone I stood

With Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,

In the pavilion:  there like parting hopes

I heard them passing from me:  hoof by hoof,

And every hoof a knell to my desires,

Clanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,

'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!'

For blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled

In the river.  Out I sprang from glow to gloom:

There whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch

Rapt to the horrible fall:  a glance I gave,

No more; but woman-vested as I was

Plunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then

Oaring one arm, and bearing in my left

The weight of all the hopes of half the world,

Strove to buffet to land in vain.  A tree

Was half-disrooted from his place and stooped

To wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave

Mid-channel.  Right on this we drove and caught,

And grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.


There stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped

In the hollow bank.  One reaching forward drew

My burthen from mine arms; they cried 'she lives:'

They bore her back into the tent:  but I,

So much a kind of shame within me wrought,

Not yet endured to meet her opening eyes,

Nor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot

(For since her horse was lost I left her mine)

Across the woods, and less from Indian craft

Than beelike instinct hiveward, found at length

The garden portals.  Two great statues, Art

And Science, Caryatids, lifted up

A weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves

Of open-work in which the hunter rued

His rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows

Had sprouted, and the branches thereupon

Spread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.


A little space was left between the horns,

Through which I clambered o'er at top with pain,

Dropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,

And, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,

Now poring on the glowworm, now the star,

I paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled

Through a great arc his seven slow suns.

                                       A step

Of lightest echo, then a loftier form

Than female, moving through the uncertain gloom,

Disturbed me with the doubt 'if this were she,'

But it was Florian.  'Hist O Hist,' he said,

'They seek us:  out so late is out of rules.

Moreover "seize the strangers" is the cry.

How came you here?' I told him:  'I' said he,

'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,

To whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.

Arriving all confused among the rest

With hooded brows I crept into the hall,

And, couched behind a Judith, underneath

The head of Holofernes peeped and saw.

Girl after girl was called to trial:  each

Disclaimed all knowledge of us:  last of all,

Melissa:  trust me, Sir, I pitied her.

She, questioned if she knew us men, at first

Was silent; closer prest, denied it not:

And then, demanded if her mother knew,

Or Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:

From whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,

Easily gathered either guilt.  She sent

For Psyche, but she was not there; she called

For Psyche's child to cast it from the doors;

She sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;

And I slipt out:  but whither will you now?

And where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:

What, if together? that were not so well.

Would rather we had never come!  I dread

His wildness, and the chances of the dark.'


'And yet,' I said, 'you wrong him more than I

That struck him:  this is proper to the clown,

Though smocked, or furred and purpled, still the clown,

To harm the thing that trusts him, and to shame

That which he says he loves:  for Cyril, howe'er

He deal in frolic, as tonight--the song

Might have been worse and sinned in grosser lips

Beyond all pardon--as it is, I hold

These flashes on the surface are not he.

He has a solid base of temperament:

But as the waterlily starts and slides

Upon the level in little puffs of wind,

Though anchored to the bottom, such is he.'


Scarce had I ceased when from a tamarisk near

Two Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:'

He, standing still, was clutched; but I began

To thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind

And double in and out the boles, and race

By all the fountains:  fleet I was of foot:

Before me showered the rose in flakes; behind

I heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear

Bubbled the nightingale and heeded not,

And secret laughter tickled all my soul.

At last I hooked my ankle in a vine,

That claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne,

And falling on my face was caught and known.


They haled us to the Princess where she sat

High in the hall:  above her drooped a lamp,

And made the single jewel on her brow

Burn like the mystic fire on a mast-head,

Prophet of storm:  a handmaid on each side

Bowed toward her, combing out her long black hair

Damp from the river; and close behind her stood

Eight daughters of the plough, stronger than men,

Huge women blowzed with health, and wind, and rain,

And labour.  Each was like a Druid rock;

Or like a spire of land that stands apart

Cleft from the main, and wailed about with mews.


Then, as we came, the crowd dividing clove

An advent to the throne:  and therebeside,

Half-naked as if caught at once from bed

And tumbled on the purple footcloth, lay

The lily-shining child; and on the left,

Bowed on her palms and folded up from wrong,

Her round white shoulder shaken with her sobs,

Melissa knelt; but Lady Blanche erect

Stood up and spake, an affluent orator.


'It was not thus, O Princess, in old days:

You prized my counsel, lived upon my lips:

I led you then to all the Castalies;

I fed you with the milk of every Muse;

I loved you like this kneeler, and you me

Your second mother:  those were gracious times.

Then came your new friend:  you began to change--

I saw it and grieved--to slacken and to cool;

Till taken with her seeming openness

You turned your warmer currents all to her,

To me you froze:  this was my meed for all.

Yet I bore up in part from ancient love,

And partly that I hoped to win you back,

And partly conscious of my own deserts,

And partly that you were my civil head,

And chiefly you were born for something great,

In which I might your fellow-worker be,

When time should serve; and thus a noble scheme

Grew up from seed we two long since had sown;

In us true growth, in her a Jonah's gourd,

Up in one night and due to sudden sun:

We took this palace; but even from the first

You stood in your own light and darkened mine.

What student came but that you planed her path

To Lady Psyche, younger, not so wise,

A foreigner, and I your countrywoman,

I your old friend and tried, she new in all?

But still her lists were swelled and mine were lean;

Yet I bore up in hope she would be known:

Then came these wolves:  ~they~ knew her:  ~they~ endured,

Long-closeted with her the yestermorn,

To tell her what they were, and she to hear:

And me none told:  not less to an eye like mine

A lidless watcher of the public weal,

Last night, their mask was patent, and my foot

Was to you:  but I thought again:  I feared

To meet a cold "We thank you, we shall hear of it

From Lady Psyche:" you had gone to her,

She told, perforce; and winning easy grace

No doubt, for slight delay, remained among us

In our young nursery still unknown, the stem

Less grain than touchwood, while my honest heat

Were all miscounted as malignant haste

To push my rival out of place and power.

But public use required she should be known;

And since my oath was ta'en for public use,

I broke the letter of it to keep the sense.

I spoke not then at first, but watched them well,

Saw that they kept apart, no mischief done;

And yet this day (though you should hate me for it)

I came to tell you; found that you had gone,

Ridden to the hills, she likewise:  now, I thought,

That surely she will speak; if not, then I:

Did she?  These monsters blazoned what they were,

According to the coarseness of their kind,

For thus I hear; and known at last (my work)

And full of cowardice and guilty shame,

I grant in her some sense of shame, she flies;

And I remain on whom to wreak your rage,

I, that have lent my life to build up yours,

I that have wasted here health, wealth, and time,

And talent, I--you know it--I will not boast:

Dismiss me, and I prophesy your plan,

Divorced from my experience, will be chaff

For every gust of chance, and men will say

We did not know the real light, but chased

The wisp that flickers where no foot can tread.'


She ceased:  the Princess answered coldly, 'Good:

Your oath is broken:  we dismiss you:  go.

For this lost lamb (she pointed to the child)

Our mind is changed:  we take it to ourself.'


Thereat the Lady stretched a vulture throat,

And shot from crooked lips a haggard smile.

'The plan was mine.  I built the nest' she said

'To hatch the cuckoo.  Rise!' and stooped to updrag

Melissa:  she, half on her mother propt,

Half-drooping from her, turned her face, and cast

A liquid look on Ida, full of prayer,

Which melted Florian's fancy as she hung,

A Niobëan daughter, one arm out,

Appealing to the bolts of Heaven; and while

We gazed upon her came a little stir

About the doors, and on a sudden rushed

Among us, out of breath as one pursued,

A woman-post in flying raiment.  Fear

Stared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged

Her transit to the throne, whereby she fell

Delivering sealed dispatches which the Head

Took half-amazed, and in her lion's mood

Tore open, silent we with blind surmise

Regarding, while she read, till over brow

And cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom

As of some fire against a stormy cloud,

When the wild peasant rights himself, the rick

Flames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;

For anger most it seemed, while now her breast,

Beaten with some great passion at her heart,

Palpitated, her hand shook, and we heard

In the dead hush the papers that she held

Rustle:  at once the lost lamb at her feet

Sent out a bitter bleating for its dam;

The plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed

The scrolls together, made a sudden turn

As if to speak, but, utterance failing her,

She whirled them on to me, as who should say

'Read,' and I read--two letters--one her sire's.


'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,

We knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,

We, conscious of what temper you are built,

Came all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell

Into his father's hands, who has this night,

You lying close upon his territory,

Slipt round and in the dark invested you,

And here he keeps me hostage for his son.'


The second was my father's running thus:

'You have our son:  touch not a hair of his head:

Render him up unscathed:  give him your hand:

Cleave to your contract:  though indeed we hear

You hold the woman is the better man;

A rampant heresy, such as if it spread

Would make all women kick against their Lords

Through all the world, and which might well deserve

That we this night should pluck your palace down;

And we will do it, unless you send us back

Our son, on the instant, whole.'

                               So far I read;

And then stood up and spoke impetuously.


'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,

But led by golden wishes, and a hope

The child of regal compact, did I break

Your precinct; not a scorner of your sex

But venerator, zealous it should be

All that it might be:  hear me, for I bear,

Though man, yet human, whatsoe'er your wrongs,

From the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life

Less mine than yours:  my nurse would tell me of you;

I babbled for you, as babies for the moon,

Vague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me

From all high places, lived in all fair lights,

Came in long breezes rapt from inmost south

And blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn

With Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;

The leader wildswan in among the stars

Would clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light

The mellow breaker murmured Ida.  Now,

Because I would have reached you, had you been

Sphered up with Cassiopëia, or the enthroned

Persephonè in Hades, now at length,

Those winters of abeyance all worn out,

A man I came to see you:  but indeed,

Not in this frequence can I lend full tongue,

O noble Ida, to those thoughts that wait

On you, their centre:  let me say but this,

That many a famous man and woman, town

And landskip, have I heard of, after seen

The dwarfs of presage:  though when known, there grew

Another kind of beauty in detail

Made them worth knowing; but in your I found

My boyish dream involved and dazzled down

And mastered, while that after-beauty makes

Such head from act to act, from hour to hour,

Within me, that except you slay me here,

According to your bitter statute-book,

I cannot cease to follow you, as they say

The seal does music; who desire you more

Than growing boys their manhood; dying lips,

With many thousand matters left to do,

The breath of life; O more than poor men wealth,

Than sick men health--yours, yours, not mine--but half

Without you; with you, whole; and of those halves

You worthiest; and howe'er you block and bar

Your heart with system out from mine, I hold

That it becomes no man to nurse despair,

But in the teeth of clenched antagonisms

To follow up the worthiest till he die:

Yet that I came not all unauthorized

Behold your father's letter.'

                            On one knee

Kneeling, I gave it, which she caught, and dashed

Unopened at her feet:  a tide of fierce

Invective seemed to wait behind her lips,

As waits a river level with the dam

Ready to burst and flood the world with foam:

And so she would have spoken, but there rose

A hubbub in the court of half the maids

Gathered together:  from the illumined hall

Long lanes of splendour slanted o'er a press

Of snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,

And rainbow robes, and gems and gemlike eyes,

And gold and golden heads; they to and fro

Fluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale,

All open-mouthed, all gazing to the light,

Some crying there was an army in the land,

And some that men were in the very walls,

And some they cared not; till a clamour grew

As of a new-world Babel, woman-built,

And worse-confounded:  high above them stood

The placid marble Muses, looking peace.


Not peace she looked, the Head:  but rising up

Robed in the long night of her deep hair, so

To the open window moved, remaining there

Fixt like a beacon-tower above the waves

Of tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye

Glares ruin, and the wild birds on the light

Dash themselves dead.  She stretched her arms and called

Across the tumult and the tumult fell.


'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?

On me, me, me, the storm first breaks:  ~I~ dare

All these male thunderbolts:  what is it ye fear?

Peace! there are those to avenge us and they come:

If not,--myself were like enough, O girls,

To unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,

And clad in iron burst the ranks of war,

Or, falling, promartyr of our cause,

Die:  yet I blame you not so much for fear:

Six thousand years of fear have made you that

From which I would redeem you:  but for those

That stir this hubbub--you and you--I know

Your faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn

We hold a great convention:  then shall they

That love their voices more than duty, learn

With whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live

No wiser than their mothers, household stuff,

Live chattels, mincers of each other's fame,

Full of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,

The drunkard's football, laughing-stocks of Time,

Whose brains are in their hands and in their heels

But fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,

To tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,

For ever slaves at home and fools abroad.'


She, ending, waved her hands:  thereat the crowd

Muttering, dissolved:  then with a smile, that looked

A stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,

When all the glens are drowned in azure gloom

Of thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:


'You have done well and like a gentleman,

And like a prince:  you have our thanks for all:

And you look well too in your woman's dress:

Well have you done and like a gentleman.

You saved our life:  we owe you bitter thanks:

Better have died and spilt our bones in the flood--

Then men had said--but now--What hinders me

To take such bloody vengeance on you both?--

Yet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,

You would-be quenchers of the light to be,

Barbarians, grosser than your native bears--

O would I had his sceptre for one hour!

You that have dared to break our bound, and gulled

Our servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--

~I~ wed with thee!  ~I~ bound by precontract

Your bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold

That veins the world were packed to make your crown,

And every spoken tongue should lord you.  Sir,

Your falsehood and yourself are hateful to us:

I trample on your offers and on you:

Begone:  we will not look upon you more.

Here, push them out at gates.'

                             In wrath she spake.

Then those eight mighty daughters of the plough

Bent their broad faces toward us and addressed

Their motion:  twice I sought to plead my cause,

But on my shoulder hung their heavy hands,

The weight of destiny:  so from her face

They pushed us, down the steps, and through the court,

And with grim laughter thrust us out at gates.


We crossed the street and gained a petty mound

Beyond it, whence we saw the lights and heard the voices murmuring.  While I listened, came

On a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:

I seemed to move among a world of ghosts;

The Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,

The jest and earnest working side by side,

The cataract and the tumult and the kings

Were shadows; and the long fantastic night

With all its doings had and had not been,

And all things were and were not.

                                This went by

As strangely as it came, and on my spirits

Settled a gentle cloud of melancholy;

Not long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts

And sudden ghostly shadowings I was one

To whom the touch of all mischance but came

As night to him that sitting on a hill

Sees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun

Set into sunrise; then we moved away.



Thy voice is heard through rolling drums,

  That beat to battle where he stands;

Thy face across his fancy comes,

  And gives the battle to his hands:

A moment, while the trumpets blow,

  He sees his brood about thy knee;

The next, like fire he meets the foe,

  And strikes him dead for thine and thee.



So Lilia sang:  we thought her half-possessed,

She struck such warbling fury through the words;

And, after, feigning pique at what she called

The raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--

Like one that wishes at a dance to change

The music--clapt her hands and cried for war,

Or some grand fight to kill and make an end:

And he that next inherited the tale

Half turning to the broken statue, said,

'Sir Ralph has got your colours:  if I prove

Your knight, and fight your battle, what for me?'

It chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb

Lay by her like a model of her hand.

She took it and she flung it.  'Fight' she said,

'And make us all we would be, great and good.'

He knightlike in his cap instead of casque,

A cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,

Arranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.

Poem 140: The Princess (part 5)

Now, scarce three paces measured from the mound,

We stumbled on a stationary voice,

And 'Stand, who goes?'  'Two from the palace' I.

'The second two:  they wait,' he said, 'pass on;

His Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,

By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led

Threading the soldier-city, till we heard

The drowsy folds of our great ensign shake

From blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent

Whispers of war.

               Entering, the sudden light

Dazed me half-blind:  I stood and seemed to hear,

As in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes

A lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,

Each hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then

A strangled titter, out of which there brake

On all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,

Unmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings

Began to wag their baldness up and down,

The fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,

The huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,

And slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.


At length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,

Panted from weary sides 'King, you are free!

We did but keep you surety for our son,

If this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,

That tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'

For I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,

More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,

And all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.

Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm

A whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,

He has been among his shadows.'  'Satan take

The old women and their shadows! (thus the King

Roared) make yourself a man to fight with men.

Go:  Cyril told us all.'

                       As boys that slink

From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,

Away we stole, and transient in a trice

From what was left of faded woman-slough

To sheathing splendours and the golden scale

Of harness, issued in the sun, that now

Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,

And hit the Northern hills.  Here Cyril met us.

A little shy at first, but by and by

We twain, with mutual pardon asked and given

For stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon

Followed his tale.  Amazed he fled away

Through the dark land, and later in the night

Had come on Psyche weeping:  'then we fell

Into your father's hand, and there she lies,

But will not speak, or stir.'

                            He showed a tent

A stone-shot off:  we entered in, and there

Among piled arms and rough accoutrements,

Pitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,

Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,

And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,

All her fair length upon the ground she lay:

And at her head a follower of the camp,

A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,

Sat watching like the watcher by the dead.


Then Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,

'Lift up your head, sweet sister:  lie not thus.

What have you done but right? you could not slay

Me, nor your prince:  look up:  be comforted:

Sweet is it to have done the thing one ought,

When fallen in darker ways.'  And likewise I:

'Be comforted:  have I not lost her too,

In whose least act abides the nameless charm

That none has else for me?'  She heard, she moved,

She moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,

And raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth

As those that mourn half-shrouded over death

In deathless marble.  'Her,' she said, 'my friend--

Parted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--

Where shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?

O base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'

To whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray

Take comfort:  live, dear lady, for your child!'

At which she lifted up her voice and cried.


'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,

My one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!

For now will cruel Ida keep her back;

And either she will die from want of care,

Or sicken with ill-usage, when they say

The child is hers--for every little fault,

The child is hers; and they will beat my girl

Remembering her mother:  O my flower!

Or they will take her, they will make her hard,

And she will pass me by in after-life

With some cold reverence worse than were she dead.

Ill mother that I was to leave her there,

To lag behind, scared by the cry they made,

The horror of the shame among them all:

But I will go and sit beside the doors,

And make a wild petition night and day,

Until they hate to hear me like a wind

Wailing for ever, till they open to me,

And lay my little blossom at my feet,

My babe, my sweet Aglaïa, my one child:

And I will take her up and go my way,

And satisfy my soul with kissing her:

Ah! what might that man not deserve of me

Who gave me back my child?'  'Be comforted,'

Said Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again

She veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so

Like tender things that being caught feign death,

Spoke not, nor stirred.

                      By this a murmur ran

Through all the camp and inward raced the scouts

With rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.

We left her by the woman, and without

Found the gray kings at parle:  and 'Look you' cried

My father 'that our compact be fulfilled:

You have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:

She wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:

But red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;

She yields, or war.'

                   Then Gama turned to me:

'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time

With our strange girl:  and yet they say that still

You love her.  Give us, then, your mind at large:

How say you, war or not?'

                        'Not war, if possible,

O king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,

The desecrated shrine, the trampled year,

The smouldering homestead, and the household flower

Torn from the lintel--all the common wrong--

A smoke go up through which I loom to her

Three times a monster:  now she lightens scorn

At him that mars her plan, but then would hate

(And every voice she talked with ratify it,

And every face she looked on justify it)

The general foe.  More soluble is this knot,

By gentleness than war.  I want her love.

What were I nigher this although we dashed

Your cities into shards with catapults,

She would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,

The lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,

Not ever would she love; but brooding turn

The book of scorn, till all my flitting chance

Were caught within the record of her wrongs,

And crushed to death:  and rather, Sire, than this

I would the old God of war himself were dead,

Forgotten, rusting on his iron hills,

Rotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,

Or like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,

Not to be molten out.'

                     And roughly spake

My father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.

Boy, when I hear you prate I almost think

That idiot legend credible.  Look you, Sir!

Man is the hunter; woman is his game:

The sleek and shining creatures of the chase,

We hunt them for the beauty of their skins;

They love us for it, and we ride them down.

Wheedling and siding with them!  Out! for shame!

Boy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them

As he that does the thing they dare not do,

Breathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes

With the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in

Among the women, snares them by the score

Flattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death

He reddens what he kisses:  thus I won

You mother, a good mother, a good wife,

Worth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness

To such as her! if Cyril spake her true,

To catch a dragon in a cherry net,

To trip a tigress with a gossamer

Were wisdom to it.'

                  'Yea but Sire,' I cried,

'Wild natures need wise curbs.  The soldier?  No:

What dares not Ida do that she should prize

The soldier?  I beheld her, when she rose

The yesternight, and storming in extremes,

Stood for her cause, and flung defiance down

Gagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,

No, not the soldier's:  yet I hold her, king,

True woman:  you clash them all in one,

That have as many differences as we.

The violet varies from the lily as far

As oak from elm:  one loves the soldier, one

The silken priest of peace, one this, one that,

And some unworthily; their sinless faith,

A maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,

Glorifying clown and satyr; whence they need

More breadth of culture:  is not Ida right?

They worth it? truer to the law within?

Severer in the logic of a life?

Twice as magnetic to sweet influences

Of earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,

My mother, looks as whole as some serene

Creation minted in the golden moods

Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,

But pure as lines of green that streak the white

Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,

Not like the piebald miscellany, man,

Bursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,

But whole and one:  and take them all-in-all,

Were we ourselves but half as good, as kind,

As truthful, much that Ida claims as right

Had ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs

As dues of Nature.  To our point:  not war:

Lest I lose all.'

                'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'

Said Gama.  'We remember love ourself

In our sweet youth; we did not rate him then

This red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.

You talk almost like Ida:  ~she~ can talk;

And there is something in it as you say:

But you talk kindlier:  we esteem you for it.--

He seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,

I would he had our daughter:  for the rest,

Our own detention, why, the causes weighed,

Fatherly fears--you used us courteously--

We would do much to gratify your Prince--

We pardon it; and for your ingress here

Upon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,

you did but come as goblins in the night,

Nor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,

Nor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,

Nor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:

But let your Prince (our royal word upon it,

He comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,

And speak with Arac:  Arac's word is thrice

As ours with Ida:  something may be done--

I know not what--and ours shall see us friends.

You, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,

Follow us:  who knows? we four may build some plan

Foursquare to opposition.'

                         Here he reached

White hands of farewell to my sire, who growled

An answer which, half-muffled in his beard,

Let so much out as gave us leave to go.


Then rode we with the old king across the lawns

Beneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring

In every bole, a song on every spray

Of birds that piped their Valentines, and woke

Desire in me to infuse my tale of love

In the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed

All o'er with honeyed answer as we rode

And blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews

Gathered by night and peace, with each light air

On our mailed heads:  but other thoughts than Peace

Burnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,

And squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers

With clamour:  for among them rose a cry

As if to greet the king; they made a halt;

The horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum

Beat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;

And in the blast and bray of the long horn

And serpent-throated bugle, undulated

The banner:  anon to meet us lightly pranced

Three captains out; nor ever had I seen

Such thews of men:  the midmost and the highest

Was Arac:  all about his motion clung

The shadow of his sister, as the beam

Of the East, that played upon them, made them glance

Like those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,

That glitter burnished by the frosty dark;

And as the fiery Sirius alters hue,

And bickers into red and emerald, shone

Their morions, washed with morning, as they came.


And I that prated peace, when first I heard

War-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,

Whose home is in the sinews of a man,

Stir in me as to strike:  then took the king

His three broad sons; with now a wandering hand

And now a pointed finger, told them all:

A common light of smiles at our disguise

Broke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest

Had laboured down within his ample lungs,

The genial giant, Arac, rolled himself

Thrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.


'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself

Your captive, yet my father wills not war:

And, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?

but then this question of your troth remains:

And there's a downright honest meaning in her;

She flies too high, she flies too high! and yet

She asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;

She prest and prest it on me--I myself,

What know I of these things? but, life and soul!

I thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;

I say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?

I take her for the flower of womankind,

And so I often told her, right or wrong,

And, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,

And, right or wrong, I care not:  this is all,

I stand upon her side:  she made me swear it--

'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--

Swear by St something--I forget her name--

Her that talked down the fifty wisest men;

~She~ was a princess too; and so I swore.

Come, this is all; she will not:  waive your claim:

If not, the foughten field, what else, at once

Decides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'


I lagged in answer loth to render up

My precontract, and loth by brainless war

To cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;

Till one of those two brothers, half aside

And fingering at the hair about his lip,

To prick us on to combat 'Like to like!

The woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'

A taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!

For fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,

And sharp I answered, touched upon the point

Where idle boys are cowards to their shame,

'Decide it here:  why not? we are three to three.'


Then spake the third 'But three to three? no more?

No more, and in our noble sister's cause?

More, more, for honour:  every captain waits

Hungry for honour, angry for his king.

More, more some fifty on a side, that each

May breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow

Of these or those, the question settled die.'


'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,

This flake of rainbow flying on the highest

Foam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.

It needs must be for honour if at all:

Since, what decision? if we fail, we fail,

And if we win, we fail:  she would not keep

Her compact.'  ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'

Said Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should

Bide by this issue:  let our missive through,

And you shall have her answer by the word.'


'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen

To her false daughters in the pool; for none

Regarded; neither seemed there more to say:

Back rode we to my father's camp, and found

He thrice had sent a herald to the gates,

To learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,

Or by denial flush her babbling wells

With her own people's life:  three times he went:

The first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:

He battered at the doors; none came:  the next,

An awful voice within had warned him thence:

The third, and those eight daughters of the plough

Came sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,

And so belaboured him on rib and cheek

They made him wild:  not less one glance he caught

Through open doors of Ida stationed there

Unshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm

Though compassed by two armies and the noise

Of arms; and standing like a stately Pine

Set in a cataract on an island-crag,

When storm is on the heights, and right and left

Sucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll

The torrents, dashed to the vale:  and yet her will

Bred will in me to overcome it or fall.


But when I told the king that I was pledged

To fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed

His iron palms together with a cry;

Himself would tilt it out among the lads:

But overborne by all his bearded lords

With reasons drawn from age and state, perforce

He yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:

And many a bold knight started up in heat,

And sware to combat for my claim till death.


All on this side the palace ran the field

Flat to the garden-wall:  and likewise here,

Above the garden's glowing blossom-belts,

A columned entry shone and marble stairs,

And great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris

And what she did to Cyrus after fight,

But now fast barred:  so here upon the flat

All that long morn the lists were hammered up,

And all that morn the heralds to and fro,

With message and defiance, went and came;

Last, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,

But shaken here and there, and rolling words

Oration-like.  I kissed it and I read.


'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,

What heats of indignation when we heard

Of those that iron-cramped their women's feet;

Of lands in which at the altar the poor bride

Gives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;

Of living hearts that crack within the fire

Where smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--

Mothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling

Their pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops

The vulture, beak and talon, at the heart

Made for all noble motion:  and I saw

That equal baseness lived in sleeker times

With smoother men:  the old leaven leavened all:

Millions of throats would bawl for civil rights,

No woman named:  therefore I set my face

Against all men, and lived but for mine own.

Far off from men I built a fold for them:

I stored it full of rich memorial:

I fenced it round with gallant institutes,

And biting laws to scare the beasts of prey

And prospered; till a rout of saucy boys

Brake on us at our books, and marred our peace,

Masked like our maids, blustering I know not what

Of insolence and love, some pretext held

Of baby troth, invalid, since my will

Sealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--

I tamed my leopards:  shall I not tame these?

Or you? or I? for since you think me touched

In honour--what, I would not aught of false--

Is not our case pure? and whereas I know

Your prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood

You draw from, fight; you failing, I abide

What end soever:  fail you will not.  Still

Take not his life:  he risked it for my own;

His mother lives:  yet whatsoe'er you do,

Fight and fight well; strike and strike him.  O dear

Brothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you

The sole men to be mingled with our cause,

The sole men we shall prize in the after-time,

Your very armour hallowed, and your statues

Reared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,

We plant a solid foot into the Time,

And mould a generation strong to move

With claim on claim from right to right, till she

Whose name is yoked with children's, know herself;

And Knowledge in our own land make her free,

And, ever following those two crownèd twins,

Commerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain

Of freedom broadcast over all the orbs

Between the Northern and the Southern morn.'


Then came a postscript dashed across the rest.

See that there be no traitors in your camp:

We seem a nest of traitors--none to trust

Since our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!

Almost our maids were better at their homes,

Than thus man-girdled here:  indeed I think

Our chiefest comfort is the little child

Of one unworthy mother; which she left:

She shall not have it back:  the child shall grow

To prize the authentic mother of her mind.

I took it for an hour in mine own bed

This morning:  there the tender orphan hands

Felt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence

The wrath I nursed against the world:  farewell.'


I ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit

Upon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,

And breed up warriors!  See now, though yourself

Be dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs

That swallow common sense, the spindling king,

This Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.

When the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,

And topples down the scales; but this is fixt

As are the roots of earth and base of all;

Man for the field and woman for the hearth:

Man for the sword and for the needle she:

Man with the head and woman with the heart:

Man to command and woman to obey;

All else confusion.  Look you! the gray mare

Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills

From tile to scullery, and her small goodman

Shrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell

Mix with his hearth:  but you--she's yet a colt--

Take, break her:  strongly groomed and straitly curbed

She might not rank with those detestable

That let the bantling scald at home, and brawl

Their rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.

They say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:

~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!

Besides, the woman wed is not as we,

But suffers change of frame.  A lusty brace

Of twins may weed her of her folly.  Boy,

The bearing and the training of a child

Is woman's wisdom.'

                  Thus the hard old king:

I took my leave, for it was nearly noon:

I pored upon her letter which I held,

And on the little clause 'take not his life:'

I mused on that wild morning in the woods,

And on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'

I thought on all the wrathful king had said,

And how the strange betrothment was to end:

Then I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse

That one should fight with shadows and should fall;

And like a flash the weird affection came:

King, camp and college turned to hollow shows;

I seemed to move in old memorial tilts,

And doing battle with forgotten ghosts,

To dream myself the shadow of a dream:

And ere I woke it was the point of noon,

The lists were ready.  Empanoplied and plumed

We entered in, and waited, fifty there

Opposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared

At the barrier like a wild horn in a land

Of echoes, and a moment, and once more

The trumpet, and again:  at which the storm

Of galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears

And riders front to front, until they closed

In conflict with the crash of shivering points,

And thunder.  Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed

Of fighting.  On his haunches rose the steed,

And into fiery splinters leapt the lance,

And out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.

Part sat like rocks:  part reeled but kept their seats:

Part rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:

Part stumbled mixt with floundering horses.  Down

From those two bulks at Arac's side, and down

From Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,

The large blows rained, as here and everywhere

He rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,

And all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--

Shocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged

With hammers; till I thought, can this be he

From Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,

The mother makes us most--and in my dream

I glanced aside, and saw the palace-front

Alive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,

And highest, among the statues, statuelike,

Between a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,

With Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,

A single band of gold about her hair,

Like a Saint's glory up in heaven:  but she

No saint--inexorable--no tenderness--

Too hard, too cruel:  yet she sees me fight,

Yea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave

Among the thickest and bore down a Prince,

And Cyril, one.  Yea, let me make my dream

All that I would.  But that large-moulded man,

His visage all agrin as at a wake,

Made at me through the press, and, staggering back

With stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came

As comes a pillar of electric cloud,

Flaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,

And shadowing down the champaign till it strikes

On a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,

And twists the grain with such a roar that Earth

Reels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything

Game way before him:  only Florian, he

That loved me closer than his own right eye,

Thrust in between; but Arac rode him down:

And Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,

With Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,

Strong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;

But tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote

And threw him:  last I spurred; I felt my veins

Stretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,

And sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,

Till I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,

I did but shear a feather, and dream and truth

Flowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.



Home they brought her warrior dead:

  She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:

All her maidens, watching, said,

  'She must weep or she will die.'


Then they praised him, soft and low,

  Called him worthy to be loved,

Truest friend and noblest foe;

  Yet she neither spoke nor moved.


Stole a maiden from her place,

  Lightly to the warrior stept,

Took the face-cloth from the face;

  Yet she neither moved nor wept.


Rose a nurse of ninety years,

  Set his child upon her knee--

Like summer tempest came her tears--

  'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'

Poem 141: The Princess (part 6)

My dream had never died or lived again.

As in some mystic middle state I lay;

Seeing I saw not, hearing not I heard:

Though, if I saw not, yet they told me all

So often that I speak as having seen.


For so it seemed, or so they said to me,

That all things grew more tragic and more strange;

That when our side was vanquished and my cause

For ever lost, there went up a great cry,

The Prince is slain.  My father heard and ran

In on the lists, and there unlaced my casque

And grovelled on my body, and after him

Came Psyche, sorrowing for Aglaïa.

But high upon the palace Ida stood

With Psyche's babe in arm:  there on the roofs

Like that great dame of Lapidoth she sang.



  'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  the seed,

The little seed they laughed at in the dark,

Has risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk

Of spanless girth, that lays on every side

A thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.


  'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they came;

The leaves were wet with women's tears:  they heard

A noise of songs they would not understand:

They marked it with the red cross to the fall,

And would have strown it, and are fallen themselves.


  'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they came,

The woodmen with their axes:  lo the tree!

But we will make it faggots for the hearth,

And shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,

And boats and bridges for the use of men.


  'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they struck;

With their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew

There dwelt an iron nature in the grain:

The glittering axe was broken in their arms,

Their arms were shattered to the shoulder blade.


  'Our enemies have fallen, but this shall grow

A night of Summer from the heat, a breadth

Of Autumn, dropping fruits of power:  and rolled

With music in the growing breeze of Time,

The tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs

Shall move the stony bases of the world.


'And now, O maids, behold our sanctuary

Is violate, our laws broken:  fear we not

To break them more in their behoof, whose arms

Championed our cause and won it with a day

Blanched in our annals, and perpetual feast,

When dames and heroines of the golden year

Shall strip a hundred hollows bare of Spring,

To rain an April of ovation round

Their statues, borne aloft, the three:  but come,

We will be liberal, since our rights are won.

Let them not lie in the tents with coarse mankind,

Ill nurses; but descend, and proffer these

The brethren of our blood and cause, that there

Lie bruised and maimed, the tender ministries

Of female hands and hospitality.'


She spoke, and with the babe yet in her arms,

Descending, burst the great bronze valves, and led

A hundred maids in train across the Park.

Some cowled, and some bare-headed, on they came,

Their feet in flowers, her loveliest:  by them went

The enamoured air sighing, and on their curls

From the high tree the blossom wavering fell,

And over them the tremulous isles of light

Slided, they moving under shade:  but Blanche

At distance followed:  so they came:  anon

Through open field into the lists they wound

Timorously; and as the leader of the herd

That holds a stately fretwork to the Sun,

And followed up by a hundred airy does,

Steps with a tender foot, light as on air,

The lovely, lordly creature floated on

To where her wounded brethren lay; there stayed;

Knelt on one knee,--the child on one,--and prest

Their hands, and called them dear deliverers,

And happy warriors, and immortal names,

And said 'You shall not lie in the tents but here,

And nursed by those for whom you fought, and served

With female hands and hospitality.'


Then, whether moved by this, or was it chance,

She past my way.  Up started from my side

The old lion, glaring with his whelpless eye,

Silent; but when she saw me lying stark,

Dishelmed and mute, and motionlessly pale,

Cold even to her, she sighed; and when she saw

The haggard father's face and reverend beard

Of grisly twine, all dabbled with the blood

Of his own son, shuddered, a twitch of pain

Tortured her mouth, and o'er her forehead past

A shadow, and her hue changed, and she said:

'He saved my life:  my brother slew him for it.'

No more:  at which the king in bitter scorn

Drew from my neck the painting and the tress,

And held them up:  she saw them, and a day

Rose from the distance on her memory,

When the good Queen, her mother, shore the tress

With kisses, ere the days of Lady Blanche:

And then once more she looked at my pale face:

Till understanding all the foolish work

Of Fancy, and the bitter close of all,

Her iron will was broken in her mind;

Her noble heart was molten in her breast;

She bowed, she set the child on the earth; she laid

A feeling finger on my brows, and presently

'O Sire,' she said, 'he lives:  he is not dead:

O let me have him with my brethren here

In our own palace:  we will tend on him

Like one of these; if so, by any means,

To lighten this great clog of thanks, that make

Our progress falter to the woman's goal.'


She said:  but at the happy word 'he lives'

My father stooped, re-fathered o'er my wounds.

So those two foes above my fallen life,

With brow to brow like night and evening mixt

Their dark and gray, while Psyche ever stole

A little nearer, till the babe that by us,

Half-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,

Lay like a new-fallen meteor on the grass,

Uncared for, spied its mother and began

A blind and babbling laughter, and to dance

Its body, and reach its fatling innocent arms

And lazy lingering fingers.  She the appeal

Brooked not, but clamouring out 'Mine--mine--not yours,

It is not yours, but mine:  give me the child'

Ceased all on tremble:  piteous was the cry:

So stood the unhappy mother open-mouthed,

And turned each face her way:  wan was her cheek

With hollow watch, her blooming mantle torn,

Red grief and mother's hunger in her eye,

And down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half

The sacred mother's bosom, panting, burst

The laces toward her babe; but she nor cared

Nor knew it, clamouring on, till Ida heard,

Looked up, and rising slowly from me, stood

Erect and silent, striking with her glance

The mother, me, the child; but he that lay

Beside us, Cyril, battered as he was,

Trailed himself up on one knee:  then he drew

Her robe to meet his lips, and down she looked

At the armed man sideways, pitying as it seemed,

Or self-involved; but when she learnt his face,

Remembering his ill-omened song, arose

Once more through all her height, and o'er him grew

Tall as a figure lengthened on the sand

When the tide ebbs in sunshine, and he said:


'O fair and strong and terrible!  Lioness

That with your long locks play the Lion's mane!

But Love and Nature, these are two more terrible

And stronger.  See, your foot is on our necks,

We vanquished, you the Victor of your will.

What would you more? Give her the child! remain

Orbed in your isolation:  he is dead,

Or all as dead:  henceforth we let you be:

Win you the hearts of women; and beware

Lest, where you seek the common love of these,

The common hate with the revolving wheel

Should drag you down, and some great Nemesis

Break from a darkened future, crowned with fire,

And tread you out for ever:  but howso'er

Fixed in yourself, never in your own arms

To hold your own, deny not hers to her,

Give her the child!  O if, I say, you keep

One pulse that beats true woman, if you loved

The breast that fed or arm that dandled you,

Or own one port of sense not flint to prayer,

Give her the child! or if you scorn to lay it,

Yourself, in hands so lately claspt with yours,

Or speak to her, your dearest, her one fault,

The tenderness, not yours, that could not kill,

Give ~me~ it:  ~I~ will give it her.

                               He said:

At first her eye with slow dilation rolled

Dry flame, she listening; after sank and sank

And, into mournful twilight mellowing, dwelt

Full on the child; she took it:  'Pretty bud!

Lily of the vale! half opened bell of the woods!

Sole comfort of my dark hour, when a world

Of traitorous friend and broken system made

No purple in the distance, mystery,

Pledge of a love not to be mine, farewell;

These men are hard upon us as of old,

We two must part:  and yet how fain was I

To dream thy cause embraced in mine, to think

I might be something to thee, when I felt

Thy helpless warmth about my barren breast

In the dead prime:  but may thy mother prove

As true to thee as false, false, false to me!

And, if thou needs must needs bear the yoke, I wish it

Gentle as freedom'--here she kissed it:  then--

'All good go with thee! take it Sir,' and so

Laid the soft babe in his hard-mailèd hands,

Who turned half-round to Psyche as she sprang

To meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks;

Then felt it sound and whole from head to foot,

And hugged and never hugged it close enough,

And in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it,

And hid her bosom with it; after that

Put on more calm and added suppliantly:


'We two were friends:  I go to mine own land

For ever:  find some other:  as for me

I scarce am fit for your great plans:  yet speak to me,

Say one soft word and let me part forgiven.'


But Ida spoke not, rapt upon the child.

Then Arac.  'Ida--'sdeath! you blame the man;

You wrong yourselves--the woman is so hard

Upon the woman.  Come, a grace to me!

I am your warrior:  I and mine have fought

Your battle:  kiss her; take her hand, she weeps:

'Sdeath!  I would sooner fight thrice o'er than see it.'


But Ida spoke not, gazing on the ground,

And reddening in the furrows of his chin,

And moved beyond his custom, Gama said:


'I've heard that there is iron in the blood,

And I believe it.  Not one word? not one?

Whence drew you this steel temper? not from me,

Not from your mother, now a saint with saints.

She said you had a heart--I heard her say it--

"Our Ida has a heart"--just ere she died--

"But see that some on with authority

Be near her still" and I--I sought for one--

All people said she had authority--

The Lady Blanche:  much profit!  Not one word;

No! though your father sues:  see how you stand

Stiff as Lot's wife, and all the good knights maimed,

I trust that there is no one hurt to death,

For our wild whim:  and was it then for this,

Was it for this we gave our palace up,

Where we withdrew from summer heats and state,

And had our wine and chess beneath the planes,

And many a pleasant hour with her that's gone,

Ere you were born to vex us?  Is it kind?

Speak to her I say:  is this not she of whom,

When first she came, all flushed you said to me

Now had you got a friend of your own age,

Now could you share your thought; now should men see

Two women faster welded in one love

Than pairs of wedlock; she you walked with, she

You talked with, whole nights long, up in the tower,

Of sine and arc, spheroïd and azimuth,

And right ascension, Heaven knows what; and now

A word, but one, one little kindly word,

Not one to spare her:  out upon you, flint!

You love nor her, nor me, nor any; nay,

You shame your mother's judgment too.  Not one?

You will not? well--no heart have you, or such

As fancies like the vermin in a nut

Have fretted all to dust and bitterness.'

So said the small king moved beyond his wont.


But Ida stood nor spoke, drained of her force

By many a varying influence and so long.

Down through her limbs a drooping languor wept:

Her head a little bent; and on her mouth

A doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon

In a still water:  then brake out my sire,

Lifted his grim head from my wounds.  'O you,

Woman, whom we thought woman even now,

And were half fooled to let you tend our son,

Because he might have wished it--but we see,

The accomplice of your madness unforgiven,

And think that you might mix his draught with death,

When your skies change again:  the rougher hand

Is safer:  on to the tents:  take up the Prince.'


He rose, and while each ear was pricked to attend

A tempest, through the cloud that dimmed her broke

A genial warmth and light once more, and shone

Through glittering drops on her sad friend.

                                          'Come hither.

O Psyche,' she cried out, 'embrace me, come,

Quick while I melt; make reconcilement sure

With one that cannot keep her mind an hour:

Come to the hollow hear they slander so!

Kiss and be friends, like children being chid!

~I~ seem no more:  ~I~ want forgiveness too:

I should have had to do with none but maids,

That have no links with men.  Ah false but dear,

Dear traitor, too much loved, why?--why?--Yet see,

Before these kings we embrace you yet once more

With all forgiveness, all oblivion,

And trust, not love, you less.

                             And now, O sire,

Grant me your son, to nurse, to wait upon him,

Like mine own brother.  For my debt to him,

This nightmare weight of gratitude, I know it;

Taunt me no more:  yourself and yours shall have

Free adit; we will scatter all our maids

Till happier times each to her proper hearth:

What use to keep them here--now? grant my prayer.

Help, father, brother, help; speak to the king:

Thaw this male nature to some touch of that

Which kills me with myself, and drags me down

From my fixt height to mob me up with all

The soft and milky rabble of womankind,

Poor weakling even as they are.'

                               Passionate tears

Followed:  the king replied not:  Cyril said:

'Your brother, Lady,--Florian,--ask for him

Of your great head--for he is wounded too--

That you may tend upon him with the prince.'

'Ay so,' said Ida with a bitter smile,

'Our laws are broken:  let him enter too.'

Then Violet, she that sang the mournful song,

And had a cousin tumbled on the plain,

Petitioned too for him.  'Ay so,' she said,

'I stagger in the stream:  I cannot keep

My heart an eddy from the brawling hour:

We break our laws with ease, but let it be.'

'Ay so?' said Blanche:  'Amazed am I to her

Your Highness:  but your Highness breaks with ease

The law your Highness did not make:  'twas I.

I had been wedded wife, I knew mankind,

And blocked them out; but these men came to woo

Your Highness--verily I think to win.'


So she, and turned askance a wintry eye:

But Ida with a voice, that like a bell

Tolled by an earthquake in a trembling tower,

Rang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.


'Fling our doors wide! all, all, not one, but all,

Not only he, but by my mother's soul,

Whatever man lies wounded, friend or foe,

Shall enter, if he will.  Let our girls flit,

Till the storm die! but had you stood by us,

The roar that breaks the Pharos from his base

Had left us rock.  She fain would sting us too,

But shall not.  Pass, and mingle with your likes.

We brook no further insult but are gone.'

She turned; the very nape of her white neck

Was rosed with indignation:  but the Prince

Her brother came; the king her father charmed

Her wounded soul with words:  nor did mine own

Refuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.


Then us they lifted up, dead weights, and bare

Straight to the doors:  to them the doors gave way

Groaning, and in the Vestal entry shrieked

The virgin marble under iron heels:

And on they moved and gained the hall, and there

Rested:  but great the crush was, and each base,

To left and right, of those tall columns drowned

In silken fluctuation and the swarm

Of female whisperers:  at the further end

Was Ida by the throne, the two great cats

Close by her, like supporters on a shield,

Bow-backed with fear:  but in the centre stood

The common men with rolling eyes; amazed

They glared upon the women, and aghast

The women stared at these, all silent, save

When armour clashed or jingled, while the day,

Descending, struck athwart the hall, and shot

A flying splendour out of brass and steel,

That o'er the statues leapt from head to head,

Now fired an angry Pallas on the helm,

Now set a wrathful Dian's moon on flame,

And now and then an echo started up,

And shuddering fled from room to room, and died

Of fright in far apartments.

                           Then the voice

Of Ida sounded, issuing ordinance:

And me they bore up the broad stairs, and through

The long-laid galleries past a hundred doors

To one deep chamber shut from sound, and due

To languid limbs and sickness; left me in it;

And others otherwhere they laid; and all

That afternoon a sound arose of hoof

And chariot, many a maiden passing home

Till happier times; but some were left of those

Held sagest, and the great lords out and in,

From those two hosts that lay beside the walls,

Walked at their will, and everything was changed.



Ask me no more:  the moon may draw the sea;

  The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape

  With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;

But O too fond, when have I answered thee?

                      Ask me no more.


Ask me no more:  what answer should I give?

  I love not hollow cheek or faded eye:

  Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!

Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live;

                      Ask me no more.


Ask me no more:  thy fate and mine are sealed:

  I strove against the stream and all in vain:

  Let the great river take me to the main:

No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;

                      Ask me no more.

Poem 142: The Princess (part 7)

So was their sanctuary violated,

So their fair college turned to hospital;

At first with all confusion:  by and by

Sweet order lived again with other laws:

A kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere

Low voices with the ministering hand

Hung round the sick:  the maidens came, they talked,

They sang, they read:  till she not fair began

To gather light, and she that was, became

Her former beauty treble; and to and fro

With books, with flowers, with Angel offices,

Like creatures native unto gracious act,

And in their own clear element, they moved.


But sadness on the soul of Ida fell,

And hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.

Old studies failed; seldom she spoke:  but oft

Clomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours

On that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men

Darkening her female field:  void was her use,

And she as one that climbs a peak to gaze

O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud

Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,

Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,

And suck the blinding splendour from the sand,

And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn

Expunge the world:  so fared she gazing there;

So blackened all her world in secret, blank

And waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,

And found fair peace once more among the sick.


And twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark

Shot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I

Lay silent in the muffled cage of life:

And twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers

Drew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,

Star after Star, arose and fell; but I,

Deeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay

Quite sundered from the moving Universe,

Nor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand

That nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.


But Psyche tended Florian:  with her oft,

Melissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left

Her child among us, willing she should keep

Court-favour:  here and there the small bright head,

A light of healing, glanced about the couch,

Or through the parted silks the tender face

Peeped, shining in upon the wounded man

With blush and smile, a medicine in themselves

To wile the length from languorous hours, and draw

The sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon

He rose up whole, and those fair charities

Joined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears

So gentle, so employed, should close in love,

Than when two dewdrops on the petals shake

To the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,

And slip at once all-fragrant into one.


Less prosperously the second suit obtained

At first with Psyche.  Not though Blanche had sworn

That after that dark night among the fields

She needs must wed him for her own good name;

Not though he built upon the babe restored;

Nor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared

To incense the Head once more; till on a day

When Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind

Seen but of Psyche:  on her foot she hung

A moment, and she heard, at which her face

A little flushed, and she past on; but each

Assumed from thence a half-consent involved

In stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.


Nor only these:  Love in the sacred halls

Held carnival at will, and flying struck

With showers of random sweet on maid and man.

Nor did her father cease to press my claim,

Nor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet

Did those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;

Nor Arac, satiate with his victory.


But I lay still, and with me oft she sat:

Then came a change; for sometimes I would catch

Her hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,

And fling it like a viper off, and shriek

'You are not Ida;' clasp it once again,

And call her Ida, though I knew her not,

And call her sweet, as if in irony,

And call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:

And still she feared that I should lose my mind,

And often she believed that I should die:

Till out of long frustration of her care,

And pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,

And watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks

Throbbed thunder through the palace floors, or called

On flying Time from all their silver tongues--

And out of memories of her kindlier days,

And sidelong glances at my father's grief,

And at the happy lovers heart in heart--

And out of hauntings of my spoken love,

And lonely listenings to my muttered dream,

And often feeling of the helpless hands,

And wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--

From all a closer interest flourished up,

Tenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,

Love, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears

By some cold morning glacier; frail at first

And feeble, all unconscious of itself,

But such as gathered colour day by day.


Last I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death

For weakness:  it was evening:  silent light

Slept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought

Two grand designs; for on one side arose

The women up in wild revolt, and stormed

At the Oppian Law.  Titanic shapes, they crammed

The forum, and half-crushed among the rest

A dwarf-like Cato cowered.  On the other side

Hortensia spoke against the tax; behind,

A train of dames:  by axe and eagle sat,

With all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,

And half the wolf's-milk curdled in their veins,

The fierce triumvirs; and before them paused

Hortensia pleading:  angry was her face.


I saw the forms:  I knew not where I was:

They did but look like hollow shows; nor more

Sweet Ida:  palm to palm she sat:  the dew

Dwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape

And rounder seemed:  I moved:  I sighed:  a touch

Came round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:

Then all for languor and self-pity ran

Mine down my face, and with what life I had,

And like a flower that cannot all unfold,

So drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,

Yet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her

Fixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:


'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,

I would but ask you to fulfil yourself:

But if you be that Ida whom I knew,

I ask you nothing:  only, if a dream,

Sweet dream, be perfect.  I shall die tonight.

Stoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.'


I could no more, but lay like one in trance,

That hears his burial talked of by his friends,

And cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,

But lies and dreads his doom.  She turned; she paused;

She stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;

Leapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;

And I believed that in the living world

My spirit closed with Ida's at the lips;

Till back I fell, and from mine arms she rose

Glowing all over noble shame; and all

Her falser self slipt from her like a robe,

And left her woman, lovelier in her mood

Than in her mould that other, when she came

From barren deeps to conquer all with love;

And down the streaming crystal dropt; and she

Far-fleeted by the purple island-sides,

Naked, a double light in air and wave,

To meet her Graces, where they decked her out

For worship without end; nor end of mine,

Stateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,

Nor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,

Filled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.


Deep in the night I woke:  she, near me, held

A volume of the Poets of her land:

There to herself, all in low tones, she read.



  'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;

Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;

Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:

The fire-fly wakens:  wake thou with me.


  Now droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,

And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.


  Now lies the Earth all Danaë to the stars,

And all thy heart lies open unto me.


  Now lies the silent meteor on, and leaves

A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.


  Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,

And slips into the bosom of the lake:

So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip

Into my bosom and be lost in me.'



I heard her turn the page; she found a small

Sweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:



  'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:

What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)

In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?

But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease

To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,

To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;

And come, for love is of the valley, come,

For love is of the valley, come thou down

And find him; by the happy threshold, he,

Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,

Or red with spirted purple of the vats,

Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk

With Death and Morning on the silver horns,

Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,

Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,

That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls

To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:

But follow; let the torrent dance thee down

To find him in the valley; let the wild

Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave

The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill

Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,

That like a broken purpose waste in air:

So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales

Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth

Arise to thee; the children call, and I

Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,

Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;

Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,

The moan of doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumerable bees.'



So she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay

Listening; then looked.  Pale was the perfect face;

The bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek

Seemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,

And the voice trembled and the hand.  She said

Brokenly, that she knew it, she had failed

In sweet humility; had failed in all;

That all her labour was but as a block

Left in the quarry; but she still were loth,

She still were loth to yield herself to one

That wholly scorned to help their equal rights

Against the sons of men, and barbarous laws.

She prayed me not to judge their cause from her

That wronged it, sought far less for truth than power

In knowledge:  something wild within her breast,

A greater than all knowledge, beat her down.

And she had nursed me there from week to week:

Much had she learnt in little time.  In part

It was ill counsel had misled the girl

To vex true hearts:  yet was she but a girl--

'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!

When comes another such? never, I think,

Till the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.'

                                        Her voice

choked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,

And her great heart through all the faultful Past

Went sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;

Till notice of a change in the dark world

Was lispt about the acacias, and a bird,

That early woke to feed her little ones,

Sent from a dewy breast a cry for light:

She moved, and at her feet the volume fell.


'Blame not thyself too much,' I said, 'nor blame

Too much the sons of men and barbarous laws;

These were the rough ways of the world till now.

Henceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know

The woman's cause is man's:  they rise or sink

Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:

For she that out of Lethe scales with man

The shining steps of Nature, shares with man

His nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,

Stays all the fair young planet in her hands--

If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,

How shall men grow? but work no more alone!

Our place is much:  as far as in us lies

We two will serve them both in aiding her--

Will clear away the parasitic forms

That seem to keep her up but drag her down--

Will leave her space to burgeon out of all

Within her--let her make herself her own

To give or keep, to live and learn and be

All that not harms distinctive womanhood.

For woman is not undevelopt man,

But diverse:  could we make her as the man,

Sweet Love were slain:  his dearest bond is this,

Not like to like, but like in difference.

Yet in the long years liker must they grow;

The man be more of woman, she of man;

He gain in sweetness and in moral height,

Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;

She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,

Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;

Till at the last she set herself to man,

Like perfect music unto noble words;

And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,

Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,

Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,

Self-reverent each and reverencing each,

Distinct in individuality's,

But like each other even as those who love.

Then comes the statelier Eden back to men:

Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:

Then springs the crowning race of humankind.

May these things be!'

                    Sighing she spoke 'I fear

They will not.'

              'Dear, but let us type them now

In our own lives, and this proud watchword rest

Of equal; seeing either sex alone

Is half itself, and in true marriage lies

Nor equal, nor unequal:  each fulfils

Defect in each, and always thought in thought,

Purpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,

The single pure and perfect animal,

The two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,

Life.'

     And again sighing she spoke:  'A dream

That once was mind! what woman taught you this?'


'Alone,' I said, 'from earlier than I know,

Immersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,

I loved the woman:  he, that doth not, lives

A drowning life, besotted in sweet self,

Or pines in sad experience worse than death,

Or keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:

Yet was there one through whom I loved her, one

Not learnèd, save in gracious household ways,

Not perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,

No Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt

In Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,

Interpreter between the Gods and men,

Who looked all native to her place, and yet

On tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere

Too gross to tread, and all male minds perforce

Swayed to her from their orbits as they moved,

And girdled her with music.  Happy he

With such a mother! faith in womankind

Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high

Comes easy to him, and though he trip and fall

He shall not blind his soul with clay.'

                                      'But I,'

Said Ida, tremulously, 'so all unlike--

It seems you love to cheat yourself with words:

This mother is your model.  I have heard

of your strange doubts:  they well might be:  I seem

A mockery to my own self.  Never, Prince;

You cannot love me.'

                   'Nay but thee' I said

'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,

Ere seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw

Thee woman through the crust of iron moods

That masked thee from men's reverence up, and forced

Sweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood:  now,

Given back to life, to life indeed, through thee,

Indeed I love:  the new day comes, the light

Dearer for night, as dearer thou for faults

Lived over:  lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,

My haunting sense of hollow shows:  the change,

This truthful change in thee has killed it.  Dear,

Look up, and let thy nature strike on mine,

Like yonder morning on the blind half-world;

Approach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;

In that fine air I tremble, all the past

Melts mist-like into this bright hour, and this

Is morn to more, and all the rich to-come

Reels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels

Athwart the smoke of burning weeds.  Forgive me,

I waste my heart in signs:  let be.  My bride,

My wife, my life.  O we will walk this world,

Yoked in all exercise of noble end,

And so through those dark gates across the wild

That no man knows.  Indeed I love thee:  come,

Yield thyself up:  my hopes and thine are one:

Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;

Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.'

Poem 143: The Princess (prologue)

Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day

Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun

Up to the people:  thither flocked at noon

His tenants, wife and child, and thither half

The neighbouring borough with their Institute

Of which he was the patron.  I was there

From college, visiting the son,--the son

A Walter too,--with others of our set,

Five others:  we were seven at Vivian-place.


And me that morning Walter showed the house,

Greek, set with busts:  from vases in the hall

Flowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,

Grew side by side; and on the pavement lay

Carved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,

Huge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;

And on the tables every clime and age

Jumbled together; celts and calumets,

Claymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans

Of sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,

Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,

The cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs

From the isles of palm:  and higher on the walls,

Betwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,

His own forefathers' arms and armour hung.


And 'this' he said 'was Hugh's at Agincourt;

And that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon:

A good knight he! we keep a chronicle

With all about him'--which he brought, and I

Dived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,

Half-legend, half-historic, counts and kings

Who laid about them at their wills and died;

And mixt with these, a lady, one that armed

Her own fair head, and sallying through the gate,

Had beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.


'O miracle of women,' said the book,

'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged

By this wild king to force her to his wish,

Nor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier's death,

But now when all was lost or seemed as lost--

Her stature more than mortal in the burst

Of sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--

Brake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,

And, falling on them like a thunderbolt,

She trampled some beneath her horses' heels,

And some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,

And some were pushed with lances from the rock,

And part were drowned within the whirling brook:

O miracle of noble womanhood!'


So sang the gallant glorious chronicle;

And, I all rapt in this, 'Come out,' he said,

'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth

And sister Lilia with the rest.'  We went

(I kept the book and had my finger in it)

Down through the park:  strange was the sight to me;

For all the sloping pasture murmured, sown

With happy faces and with holiday.

There moved the multitude, a thousand heads:

The patient leaders of their Institute

Taught them with facts.  One reared a font of stone

And drew, from butts of water on the slope,

The fountain of the moment, playing, now

A twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,

Or steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball

Danced like a wisp:  and somewhat lower down

A man with knobs and wires and vials fired

A cannon:  Echo answered in her sleep

From hollow fields:  and here were telescopes

For azure views; and there a group of girls

In circle waited, whom the electric shock

Dislinked with shrieks and laughter:  round the lake

A little clock-work steamer paddling plied

And shook the lilies:  perched about the knolls

A dozen angry models jetted steam:

A petty railway ran:  a fire-balloon

Rose gem-like up before the dusky groves

And dropt a fairy parachute and past:

And there through twenty posts of telegraph

They flashed a saucy message to and fro

Between the mimic stations; so that sport

Went hand in hand with Science; otherwhere

Pure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled

And stumped the wicket; babies rolled about

Like tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids

Arranged a country dance, and flew through light

And shadow, while the twangling violin

Struck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead

The broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime

Made noise with bees and breeze from end to end.


Strange was the sight and smacking of the time;

And long we gazed, but satiated at length

Came to the ruins.  High-arched and ivy-claspt,

Of finest Gothic lighter than a fire,

Through one wide chasm of time and frost they gave

The park, the crowd, the house; but all within

The sward was trim as any garden lawn:

And here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,

And Lilia with the rest, and lady friends

From neighbour seats:  and there was Ralph himself,

A broken statue propt against the wall,

As gay as any.  Lilia, wild with sport,

Half child half woman as she was, had wound

A scarf of orange round the stony helm,

And robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,

That made the old warrior from his ivied nook

Glow like a sunbeam:  near his tomb a feast

Shone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,

And there we joined them:  then the maiden Aunt

Took this fair day for text, and from it preached

An universal culture for the crowd,

And all things great; but we, unworthier, told

Of college:  he had climbed across the spikes,

And he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,

And he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one

Discussed his tutor, rough to common men,

But honeying at the whisper of a lord;

And one the Master, as a rogue in grain

Veneered with sanctimonious theory.

But while they talked, above their heads I saw

The feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought

My book to mind:  and opening this I read

Of old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang

With tilt and tourney; then the tale of her

That drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,

And much I praised her nobleness, and 'Where,'

Asked Walter, patting Lilia's head (she lay

Beside him) 'lives there such a woman now?'


Quick answered Lilia 'There are thousands now

Such women, but convention beats them down:

It is but bringing up; no more than that:

You men have done it:  how I hate you all!

Ah, were I something great!  I wish I were

Some might poetess, I would shame you then,

That love to keep us children!  O I wish

That I were some great princess, I would build

Far off from men a college like a man's,

And I would teach them all that men are taught;

We are twice as quick!'  And here she shook aside

The hand that played the patron with her curls.


And one said smiling 'Pretty were the sight

If our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt

With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,

And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.

I think they should not wear our rusty gowns,

But move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph

Who shines so in the corner; yet I fear,

If there were many Lilias in the brood,

However deep you might embower the nest,

Some boy would spy it.'

                      At this upon the sward

She tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:

'That's your light way; but I would make it death

For any male thing but to peep at us.'


Petulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;

A rosebud set with little wilful thorns,

And sweet as English air could make her, she:

But Walter hailed a score of names upon her,

And 'petty Ogress', and 'ungrateful Puss',

And swore he longed at college, only longed,

All else was well, for she-society.

They boated and they cricketed; they talked

At wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;

They lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;

They rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,

And caught the blossom of the flying terms,

But missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,

The little hearth-flower Lilia.  Thus he spoke,

Part banter, part affection.

                           'True,' she said,

'We doubt not that.  O yes, you missed us much.

I'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.'


She held it out; and as a parrot turns

Up through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,

And takes a lady's finger with all care,

And bites it for true heart and not for harm,

So he with Lilia's.  Daintily she shrieked

And wrung it.  'Doubt my word again!' he said.

'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:

We seven stayed at Christmas up to read;

And there we took one tutor as to read:

The hard-grained Muses of the cube and square

Were out of season:  never man, I think,

So mouldered in a sinecure as he:

For while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,

And our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,

We did but talk you over, pledge you all

In wassail; often, like as many girls--

Sick for the hollies and the yews of home--

As many little trifling Lilias--played

Charades and riddles as at Christmas here,

And ~what's my thought~ and ~when~ and ~where~ and ~how~,

As here at Christmas.'

                     She remembered that:

A pleasant game, she thought:  she liked it more

Than magic music, forfeits, all the rest.

But these--what kind of tales did men tell men,

She wondered, by themselves?

                           A half-disdain

Perched on the pouted blossom of her lips:

And Walter nodded at me; '~He~ began,

The rest would follow, each in turn; and so

We forged a sevenfold story.  Kind? what kind?

Chimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,

Seven-headed monsters only made to kill

Time by the fire in winter.'

                           'Kill him now,

The tyrant! kill him in the summer too,'

Said Lilia; 'Why not now?' the maiden Aunt.

'Why not a summer's as a winter's tale?

A tale for summer as befits the time,

And something it should be to suit the place,

Heroic, for a hero lies beneath,

Grave, solemn!'

              Walter warped his mouth at this

To something so mock-solemn, that I laughed

And Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth

An echo like a ghostly woodpecker,

Hid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt

(A little sense of wrong had touched her face

With colour) turned to me with 'As you will;

Heroic if you will, or what you will,

Or be yourself you hero if you will.'


'Take Lilia, then, for heroine' clamoured he,

'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,

Grand, epic, homicidal; and be you

The Prince to win her!'

                      'Then follow me, the Prince,'

I answered, 'each be hero in his turn!

Seven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--

Heroic seems our Princess as required--

But something made to suit with Time and place,

A Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,

A talk of college and of ladies' rights,

A feudal knight in silken masquerade,

And, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments

For which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--

This ~were~ a medley! we should have him back

Who told the "Winter's tale" to do it for us.

No matter:  we will say whatever comes.

And let the ladies sing us, if they will,

From time to time, some ballad or a song

To give us breathing-space.'

                           So I began,

And the rest followed:  and the women sang

Between the rougher voices of the men,

Like linnets in the pauses of the wind:

And here I give the story and the songs.

Poem 144: The Princess (The Conclusion)

So closed our tale, of which I give you all

The random scheme as wildly as it rose:

The words are mostly mine; for when we ceased

There came a minute's pause, and Walter said,

'I wish she had not yielded!' then to me,

'What, if you drest it up poetically?'

So prayed the men, the women:  I gave assent:

Yet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven

Together in one sheaf?  What style could suit?

The men required that I should give throughout

The sort of mock-heroic gigantesque,

With which we bantered little Lilia first:

The women--and perhaps they felt their power,

For something in the ballads which they sang,

Or in their silent influence as they sat,

Had ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque,

And drove us, last, to quite a solemn close--

They hated banter, wished for something real,

A gallant fight, a noble princess--why

Not make her true-heroic--true-sublime?

Or all, they said, as earnest as the close?

Which yet with such a framework scarce could be.

Then rose a little feud betwixt the two,

Betwixt the mockers and the realists:

And I, betwixt them both, to please them both,

And yet to give the story as it rose,

I moved as in a strange diagonal,

And maybe neither pleased myself nor them.


But Lilia pleased me, for she took no part

In our dispute:  the sequel of the tale

Had touched her; and she sat, she plucked the grass,

She flung it from her, thinking:  last, she fixt

A showery glance upon her aunt, and said,

'You--tell us what we are' who might have told,

For she was crammed with theories out of books,

But that there rose a shout:  the gates were closed

At sunset, and the crowd were swarming now,

To take their leave, about the garden rails.


So I and some went out to these:  we climbed

The slope to Vivian-place, and turning saw

The happy valleys, half in light, and half

Far-shadowing from the west, a land of peace;

Gray halls alone among their massive groves;

Trim hamlets; here and there a rustic tower

Half-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat;

The shimmering glimpses of a stream; the seas;

A red sail, or a white; and far beyond,

Imagined more than seen, the skirts of France.


'Look there, a garden!' said my college friend,

The Tory member's elder son, 'and there!

God bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,

And keeps our Britain, whole within herself,

A nation yet, the rulers and the ruled--

Some sense of duty, something of a faith,

Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made,

Some patient force to change them when we will,

Some civic manhood firm against the crowd--

But yonder, whiff! there comes a sudden heat,

The gravest citizen seems to lose his head,

The king is scared, the soldier will not fight,

The little boys begin to shoot and stab,

A kingdom topples over with a shriek

Like an old woman, and down rolls the world

In mock heroics stranger than our own;

Revolts, republics, revolutions, most

No graver than a schoolboys' barring out;

Too comic for the serious things they are,

Too solemn for the comic touches in them,

Like our wild Princess with as wise a dream

As some of theirs--God bless the narrow seas!

I wish they were a whole Atlantic broad.'


'Have patience,' I replied, 'ourselves are full

Of social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams

Are but the needful preludes of the truth:

For me, the genial day, the happy crowd,

The sport half-science, fill me with a faith.

This fine old world of ours is but a child

Yet in the go-cart.  Patience!  Give it time

To learn its limbs:  there is a hand that guides.'


In such discourse we gained the garden rails,

And there we saw Sir Walter where he stood,

Before a tower of crimson holly-hoaks,

Among six boys, head under head, and looked

No little lily-handed Baronet he,

A great broad-shouldered genial Englishman,

A lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,

A raiser of huge melons and of pine,

A patron of some thirty charities,

A pamphleteer on guano and on grain,

A quarter-sessions chairman, abler none;

Fair-haired and redder than a windy morn;

Now shaking hands with him, now him, of those

That stood the nearest--now addressed to speech--

Who spoke few words and pithy, such as closed

Welcome, farewell, and welcome for the year

To follow:  a shout rose again, and made

The long line of the approaching rookery swerve

From the elms, and shook the branches of the deer

From slope to slope through distant ferns, and rang

Beyond the bourn of sunset; O, a shout

More joyful than the city-roar that hails

Premier or king!  Why should not these great Sirs

Give up their parks some dozen times a year

To let the people breathe?  So thrice they cried,

I likewise, and in groups they streamed away.


But we went back to the Abbey, and sat on,

So much the gathering darkness charmed:  we sat

But spoke not, rapt in nameless reverie,

Perchance upon the future man:  the walls

Blackened about us, bats wheeled, and owls whooped,

And gradually the powers of the night,

That range above the region of the wind,

Deepening the courts of twilight broke them up

Through all the silent spaces of the worlds,

Beyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens.


Last little Lilia, rising quietly,

Disrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph

From those rich silks, and home well-pleased we went.

Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea;

But O too fond, when have I answer'd thee?

Ask me no more: what answer should I give?

       I love not hollow cheek or faded eye:

       Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!

Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live;

         Ask me no more.


Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal'd:

      I strove against the stream and all in vain:

      Let the great river take me to the main:

No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;

Poem 147: The Princess: A Medley: Come down, O Maid

Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:

   What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)

   In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?

   But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease

   To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,

   To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;

   And come, for Love is of the valley, come,

   For Love is of the valley, come thou down

   And find him; by the happy threshold, he,

  Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,

  Or red with spirted purple of the vats,

  Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk

  With Death and Morning on the silver horns,

  Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,

  Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,

  That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls

  To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:

  But follow; let the torrent dance thee down

  To find him in the valley; let the wild

  Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave

  The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill

  Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,

  That like a broken purpose waste in air:

  So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales

  Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth

  Arise to thee; the children call, and I

  Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,

  Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;

  Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn,

  The moan of doves in immemorial elms,

  And murmuring of innumerable bees.

Home they brought her warrior dead:

Then they praised him, soft and low,

       Call'd him worthy to be loved,

Truest friend and noblest foe;

       Yet she neither spoke nor moved.

Stole a maiden from her place,

Took the face-cloth from the face;

      Yet she neither moved nor wept.


Rose a nurse of ninety years,

Like summer tempest came her tears--

Poem 149: The Princess: A Medley: Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal

Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;

    Now lies the earth all Danaë to the stars,

        And all thy heart lies open unto me.

    Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves

       A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.


       Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,

   And slips into the bosom of the lake:

   So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip

   Into my bosom and be lost in me.

Poem 150: The Princess: A Medley: O Swallow

O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,

Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,

And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.

O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,

That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,

And dark and true and tender is the North.

O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light

Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,

And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.


O were I thou that she might take me in,

And lay me on her bosom, and her heart

Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.


Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,

Delaying as the tender ash delays

To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?


O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:

Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,

But in the North long since my nest is made.


O tell her, brief is life but love is long,

And brief the sun of summer in the North,

And brief the moon of beauty in the South.


O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,

Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,

And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.

Poem 151: The Princess: A Medley: Our Enemies have Fall'n

Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: the seed,

   The little seed they laugh'd at in the dark,

   Has risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk

   Of spanless girth, that lays on every side

   A thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.

       Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they came;

   The leaves were wet with women's tears: they heard

   A noise of songs they would not understand:

   They mark'd it with the red cross to the fall,

  And would have strown it, and are fall'n themselves.


      Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they came,

  The woodmen with their axes: lo the tree!

  But we will make it faggots for the hearth,

  And shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,

  And boats and bridges for the use of men.


      Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they struck;

  With their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew

  There dwelt an iron nature in the grain:

  The glittering axe was broken in their arms,

  Their arms were shatter'd to the shoulder blade.


      Our enemies have fall'n, but this shall grow

  A night of Summer from the heat, a breadth

  Of Autumn, dropping fruits of power; and roll'd

  With music in the growing breeze of Time,

  The tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs

  Shall move the stony bases of the world.

Poem 152: The Princess: A Medley: Tears, Idle Tears

Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,

Tears from the depth of some divine despair

Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,

In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,

And thinking of the days that are no more.

Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,

That brings our friends up from the underworld,

Sad as the last which reddens over one

That sinks with all we love below the verge;

So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.


Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns

The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds

To dying ears, when unto dying eyes

The casement slowly grows a summering square;

So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.


Dear as remember'd kisses after death,

And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd

On lips that are for others; deep as love,

Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;

O Death in Life, the days that are no more!

Poem 153: The Princess: A Medley: Thy Voice is Heard

Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,

Thy face across his fancy comes,

       And gives the battle to his hands:

A moment, while the trumpets blow,

       He sees his brood about thy knee;

The next, like fire he meets the foe,

       And strikes him dead for thine and thee.

Poem 154: The Progress of Spring

THE groundflame of the crocus breaks the mould,

     Fair Spring slides hither o'er the Southern sea,

Wavers on her thin stem the snowdrop cold

     That trembles not to kisses of the bee:

Come Spring, for now from all the dripping eaves

     The spear of ice has wept itself away,

And hour by hour unfolding woodbine leaves

     O'er his uncertain shadow droops the day.

She comes! The loosen'd rivulets run;

     The frost-bead melts upon her golden hair;

Her mantle, slowly greening in the Sun,

     Now wraps her close, now arching leaves her bar

     To breaths of balmier air;


Up leaps the lark, gone wild to welcome her,

     About her glance the tits, and shriek the jays,

Before her skims the jubilant woodpecker,

     The linnet's bosom blushes at her gaze,

While round her brows a woodland culver flits,

     Watching her large light eyes and gracious looks,

And in her open palm a halcyon sits

     Patient--the secret splendour of the brooks.

Come Spring! She comes on waste and wood,

     On farm and field: but enter also here,

Diffuse thyself at will thro' all my blood,

     And, tho' thy violet sicken into sere,

     Lodge with me all the year!


Once more a downy drift against the brakes,

     Self-darken'd in the sky, descending slow!

But gladly see I thro' the wavering flakes

     Yon blanching apricot like snow in snow.

These will thine eyes not brook in forest-paths,

     On their perpetual pine, nor round the beech;

They fuse themselves to little spicy baths,

     Solved in the tender blushes of the peach;

They lose themselves and die

     On that new life that gems the hawthorn line;

Thy gay lent-lilies wave and put them by,

     And out once more in varnish'd glory shine

     Thy stars of celandine.


She floats across the hamlet. Heaven lours,

     But in the tearful splendour of her smiles

I see the slowly-thickening chestnut towers

     Fill out the spaces by the barren tiles.

Now past her feet the swallow circling flies,

     A clamorous cuckoo stoops to meet her hand;

Her light makes rainbows in my closing eyes,

     I hear a charm of song thro' all the land.

Come, Spring! She comes, and Earth is glad

     To roll her North below thy deepening dome,

But ere thy maiden birk be wholly clad,

     And these low bushes dip their twigs in foam,

     Make all true hearths thy home.


Across my garden! and the thicket stirs,

     The fountain pulses high in sunnier jets,

The blackcap warbles, and the turtle purrs,

     The starling claps his tiny castanets.

Still round her forehead wheels the woodland dove,

     And scatters on her throat the sparks of dew,

The kingcup fills her footprint, and above

     Broaden the glowing isles of vernal blue.

Hail ample presence of a Queen,

     Bountiful, beautiful, apparell'd gay,

Whose mantle, every shade of glancing green,

     Flies back in fragrant breezes to display

     A tunic white as May!


She whispers, 'From the South I bring you balm,

     For on a tropic mountain was I born,

While some dark dweller by the coco-palm

     Watch'd my far meadow zoned with airy morn;

From under rose a muffled moan of floods;

     I sat beneath a solitude of snow;

There no one came, the turf was fresh, the woods

     Plunged gulf on gulf thro' all their vales below

I saw beyond their silent tops

     The steaming marshes of the scarlet cranes,

The slant seas leaning oll the mangrove copse,

     And summer basking in the sultry plains

     About a land of canes;


'Then from my vapour-girdle soaring forth

     I scaled the buoyant highway of the birds,

And drank the dews and drizzle of the North,

     That I might mix with men, and hear their words

On pathway'd plains; for--while my hand exults

     Within the bloodless heart of lowly flowers

To work old laws of Love to fresh results,

     Thro' manifold effect of simple powers--

I too would teach the man

     Beyond the darker hour to see the bright,

That his fresh life may close as it began,

     The still-fulfilling promise of a light

     Narrowing the bounds of night.'


So wed thee with my soul, that I may mark

     The coming year's great good and varied ills,

And new developments, whatever spark

     Be struck from out the clash of warring wills;

Or whether, since our nature cannot rest,

     The smoke of war's volcano burst again

From hoary deeps that belt the changeful West,

     Old Empires, dwellings of the kings of men;

Or should those fail, that hold the helm,

     While the long day of knowledge grows and warms,

And in the heart of this most ancient realm

     A hateful voice be utter'd, and alarms

     Sounding 'To arms! to arms!'


A simpler, saner lesson might he learn

     Who reads thy gradual process, Holy Spring.

Thy leaves possess the season in their turn,

     And in their time thy warblers rise on wing.

How surely glidest thou from March to May,

     And changest, breathing it, the sullen wind,

Thy scope of operation, day by day,

     Larger and fuller, like the human mind '

Thy warmths from bud to bud

     Accomplish that blind model in the seed,

And men have hopes, which race the restless blood

     That after many changes may succeed

     Life, which is Life indeed.

Poem 155: The Revenge - A Ballad of the Fleet

At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,

And a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from far away:

'Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted'

Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: ''Fore God I am no coward;

But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,

And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.

We are six ships of the line; can we fight with ?'


Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: 'I know you are no coward;

You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.

But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.

I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,

To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.'


So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,

Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;

But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land

Very carefully and slow,

Men of Bideford in Devon,

And we laid them on the ballast down below;

For we brought them all aboard,

And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,

To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.


He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,

And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,

With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.

'Shall we fight or shall we fly?

Good Sir Richard, tell us now,

For to fight is but to die!

There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.'

And Sir Richard said again: 'We be all good English men.

Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,

For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet.'


Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so

The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,

With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;

For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,

And the little Revenge ran on through the long sea-lane between.


Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laughed,

Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft

Running on and on, till delayed

By their mountain-like value Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,

And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,

Took the breath from our sails, and we stayed.


And while now the great  Philip hung above us like a cloud

Whence the thunderbolt will fall

Long and loud,

Four galleons drew away

From the Spanish fleet that day,

And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,

And the value broke from them all.


But anon the great  Philip, she bethought herself and went

Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;

And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,

For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,

And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears

When he leaps from the water to the land.


And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,

But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the .

Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,

Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her  and flame;

Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.

For some were sunk and many were shattered, and so could fight us no more -

God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?


For he said 'Fight on! fight on!'

Though his vessel was all but a wreck;

And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,

With a grisly wound to be dressed he had left the deck,

But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,

And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,

And he said 'Fight on! fight on!'


And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,

And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;

But they dared not touch us again, for they feared that we still could sting,

So they watched what the end would be.

And we had not fought them in vain,

But in perilous plight were we,

Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,

And half of the rest of us maimed for life

In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;

And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,

And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;

And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;

But Sir Richard cried in his English pride,

'We have fought such a fight for a day and a night

As may never be fought again!

We have won great glory, my men!

And a day less or more

At sea or ashore,

We die -does it matter when?

Sink me the ship, Master Gunner -sink her, split her in twain!

Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!'


And the gunner said 'Ay, ay,' but the seamen made reply:

'We have children, we have wives,

And the Lord hath spared our lives.

We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;

We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow.'

And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.


And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,

Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,

And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;

But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:

'I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;

I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:

With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!'

And he fell upon their decks, and he died.


And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,

And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap

That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;

Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,

But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,

And they manned the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,

And away she sailed with her loss and longed for her own;

When a wind from the lands they had ruined awoke from sleep,

And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,

And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,

And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,

Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,

And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shattered navy of Spain,

And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags

To be lost evermore in the main.

Poem 156: The Ringlet

'Your ringlets, your ringlets,

  That look so golden-gay,

If you will give me one, but one,

  To kiss it night and day,

The never chilling touch of Time

 Will turn it silver-gray;

And then shall I know it is all true gold

To flame and sparkle and stream as of old.

Till all the comets in heaven are cold,

  And all her stars decay.'

'Then take it, love, and put it by;

This cannot change, nor yet can I.'


'My ringlet, my ringlet,

 That art so golden-gay,

Now never chilling touch of Time

 Can turn thee silver-gray;

And a lad may wink, and a girl may hint,

 And a fool may say his say;

For my doubts and fears were all amiss,

And I swear henceforth by this and this,

That a doubt will only come for a kiss,

 And a fear to be kiss'd away.'

'Then kiss it, love, and put it by:

If this can change, why so can I.'


O Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 I kiss'd you night and day,

And Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 You still are golden-gay,

But Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 You should be silver-gray:

For what is this which now I'm told,

I that took you for true gold,

She that gave you 's bought and sold,

           Sold, sold.


O Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 She blush'd a rosy red,

When Ringlet, O Ringlet

 She clipt you from her head,

And Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 She gave you me, and said,

'Come, kiss it, love and put it by:

If this can change, why so can I.'

O fie, you golden nothing, fie,

            You golden lie.


O Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 I count you much to blame,

For Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 You put me much to shame,

So Ringlet, O Ringlet,

 I doom you to the flame.

For what is this which now I learn,

Has given all my faith a turn?

Burn, you glossy heretic, burn,

           Burn, burn.

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes dying, dying, dying.


O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,

  And thinner, clearer, farther going!

 O sweet and far from cliff and scar

  The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!

Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying,

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes dying, dying, dying.


O love they die in yon rich sky,

  They faint on hill or field, or river:

Poem 159: The Talking Oak

Once more the gate behind me falls;

     Once more before my face

I see the moulder'd Abbey-walls,

     That stand within the chace.


Beyond the lodge the city lies,

     Beneath its drift of smoke;

And ah! with what delighted eyes

     I turn to yonder oak.


For when my passion first began,

     Ere that, which in me burn'd,

The love, that makes me thrice a man,

     Could hope itself return'd;


To yonder oak within the field

     I spoke without restraint,

And with a larger faith appeal'd

     Than Papist unto Saint.


For oft I talk'd with him apart

     And told him of my choice,

Until he plagiarized a heart,

     And answer'd with a voice.


Tho' what he whisper'd under Heaven

     None else could understand;

I found him garrulously given,

     A babbler in the land.


But since I heard him make reply

     Is many a weary hour;

'Twere well to question him, and try

     If yet he keeps the power.


Hail, hidden to the knees in fern,

     Broad Oak of Sumner-chace,

Whose topmost branches can discern

     The roofs of Sumner-place!


Say thou, whereon I carved her name,

     If ever maid or spouse,

As fair as my Olivia, came

     To rest beneath thy boughs.---


"O Walter, I have shelter'd here

     Whatever maiden grace

The good old Summers, year by year

     Made ripe in Sumner-chace:


"Old Summers, when the monk was fat,

     And, issuing shorn and sleek,

Would twist his girdle tight, and pat

     The girls upon the cheek,


"Ere yet, in scorn of Peter's-pence,

     And number'd bead, and shrift,

Bluff Harry broke into the spence

     And turn'd the cowls adrift:


"And I have seen some score of those

     Fresh faces that would thrive

When his man-minded offset rose

     To chase the deer at five;


"And all that from the town would stroll,

     Till that wild wind made work

In which the gloomy brewer's soul

     Went by me, like a stork:


"The slight she-slips of royal blood,

     And others, passing praise,

Straight-laced, but all-too-full in bud

     For puritanic stays:


"And I have shadow'd many a group

     Of beauties, that were born

In teacup-times of hood and hoop,

     Or while the patch was worn;


"And, leg and arm with love-knots gay

     About me leap'd and laugh'd

The modish Cupid of the day,

     And shrill'd his tinsel shaft.


"I swear (and else may insects prick

     Each leaf into a gall)

This girl, for whom your heart is sick,

     Is three times worth them all.


"For those and theirs, by Nature's law,

     Have faded long ago;

But in these latter springs I saw

     Your own Olivia blow,


"From when she gamboll'd on the greens

     A baby-germ, to when

The maiden blossoms of her teens

     Could number five from ten.


"I swear, by leaf, and wind, and rain,

     (And hear me with thine ears,)

That, tho' I circle in the grain

     Five hundred rings of years---


"Yet, since I first could cast a shade,

     Did never creature pass

So slightly, musically made,

     So light upon the grass:


"For as to fairies, that will flit

     To make the greensward fresh,

I hold them exquisitely knit,

     But far too spare of flesh."


Oh, hide thy knotted knees in fern,

     And overlook the chace;

And from thy topmost branch discern

     The roofs of Sumner-place.


But thou, whereon I carved her name,

     That oft hast heard my vows,

Declare when last Olivia came

     To sport beneath thy boughs.


"O yesterday, you know, the fair

     Was holden at the town;

Her father left his good arm-chair,

     And rode his hunter down.


"And with him Albert came on his.

     I look'd at him with joy:

As cowslip unto oxlip is,

     So seems she to the boy.


"An hour had past---and, sitting straight

     Within the low-wheel'd chaise,

Her mother trundled to the gate

     Behind the dappled grays.


"But as for her, she stay'd at home,

     And on the roof she went,

And down the way you use to come,

     She look'd with discontent.


"She left the novel half-uncut

     Upon the rosewood shelf;

She left the new piano shut:

     She could not please herseif


"Then ran she, gamesome as the colt,

     And livelier than a lark

She sent her voice thro' all the holt

     Before her, and the park.


"A light wind chased her on the wing,

     And in the chase grew wild,

As close as might be would he cling

     About the darling child:


"But light as any wind that blows

     So fleetly did she stir,

The flower, she touch'd on, dipt and rose,

     And turn'd to look at her.


"And here she came, and round me play'd,

     And sang to me the whole

Of those three stanzas that you made

     About my Ôgiant bole;'


"And in a fit of frolic mirth

     She strove to span my waist:

Alas, I was so broad of girth,

     I could not be embraced.


"I wish'd myself the fair young beech

     That here beside me stands,

That round me, clasping each in each,

     She might have lock'd her hands.


"Yet seem'd the pressure thrice as sweet

     As woodbine's fragile hold,

Or when I feel about my feet

     The berried briony fold."


O muffle round thy knees with fern,

     And shadow Sumner-chace!

Long may thy topmost branch discern

     The roofs of Sumner-place!


But tell me, did she read the name

     I carved with many vows

When last with throbbing heart I came

     To rest beneath thy boughs?


"O yes, she wander'd round and round

     These knotted knees of mine,

And found, and kiss'd the name she found,

     And sweetly murmur'd thine.


"A teardrop trembled from its source,

     And down my surface crept.

My sense of touch is something coarse,

     But I believe she wept.


"Then flush'd her cheek with rosy light,

     She glanced across the plain;

But not a creature was in sight:

     She kiss'd me once again.


"Her kisses were so close and kind,

     That, trust me on my word,

Hard wood I am, and wrinkled rind,

     But yet my sap was stirr'd:


"And even into my inmost ring

     A pleasure I discern'd,

Like those blind motions of the Spring,

     That show the year is turn'd.


"Thrice-happy he that may caress

     The ringlet's waving balm---

The cushions of whose touch may press

     The maiden's tender palm.


"I, rooted here among the groves

     But languidly adjust

My vapid vegetable loves

     With anthers and with dust:


"For ah! my friend, the days were brief

     Whereof the poets talk,

When that, which breathes within the leaf,

     Could slip its bark and walk.


"But could I, as in times foregone,

     From spray, and branch, and stem,

Have suck'd and gather'd into one

     The life that spreads in them,


"She had not found me so remiss;

     But lightly issuing thro',

I would have paid her kiss for kiss,

     With usury thereto."


O flourish high, with leafy towers,

     And overlook the lea,

Pursue thy loves among the bowers

     But leave thou mine to me.


O flourish, hidden deep in fern,

     Old oak, I love thee well;

A thousand thanks for what I learn

     And what remains to tell.


" ÔTis little more: the day was warm;

     At last, tired out with play,

She sank her head upon her arm

     And at my feet she lay.


"Her eyelids dropp'd their silken eaves

I breathed upon her eyes

Thro' all the summer of my leaves

     A welcome mix'd with sighs.


"I took the swarming sound of life---

     The music from the town---

The murmurs of the drum and fife

     And lull'd them in my own.


"Sometimes I let a sunbeam slip,

     To light her shaded eye;

A second flutter'd round her lip

     Like a golden butterfly;


"A third would glimmer on her neck

     To make the necklace shine;

Another slid, a sunny fleck,

     From head to ankle fine,


"Then close and dark my arms I spread,

     And shadow'd all her rest---

Dropt dews upon her golden head,

     An acorn in her breast.


"But in a pet she started up,

     And pluck'd it out, and drew

My little oakling from the cup,

     And flung him in the dew.


"And yet it was a graceful gift---

     I felt a pang within

As when I see the woodman lift

     His axe to slay my kin.


"I shook him down because he was

     The finest on the tree.

He lies beside thee on the grass.

     O kiss him once for me.


"O kiss him twice and thrice for me,

     That have no lips to kiss,

For never yet was oak on lea

     Shall grow so fair as this.'


Step deeper yet in herb and fern,

     Look further thro' the chace,

Spread upward till thy boughs discern

     The front of Sumner-place.


This fruit of thine by Love is blest,

     That but a moment lay

Where fairer fruit of Love may rest

     Some happy future day.


I kiss it twice, I kiss it thrice,

     The warmth it thence shall win

To riper life may magnetise

     The baby-oak within.


But thou, while kingdoms overset,

     Or lapse from hand to hand,

Thy leaf shall never fail, nor yet

     Thine acorn in the land.


May never saw dismember thee,

     Nor wielded axe disjoint,

That art the fairest-spoken tree

     From here to Lizard-point.


O rock upon thy towery-top

     All throats that gurgle sweet!

All starry culmination drop

     Balm-dews to bathe thy feet!


All grass of silky feather grow---

     And while he sinks or swells

The full south-breeze around thee blow

     The sound of minster bells.


The fat earth feed thy branchy root,

     That under deeply strikes!

The northern morning o'er thee shoot,

     High up, in silver spikes!


Nor ever lightning char thy grain,

     But, rolling as in sleep,

Low thunders bring the mellow rain,

     That makes thee broad and deep!


And hear me swear a solemn oath,

     That only by thy side

Will I to Olive plight my troth,

     And gain her for my bride.


And when my marriage morn may fall,

     She, Dryad-like, shall wear

Alternate leaf and acorn-ball

     In wreath about her hair.


And I will work in prose and rhyme,

     And praise thee more in both

Than bard has honour'd beech or lime,

     Or that Thessalian growth,


In which the swarthy ringdove sat,

     And mystic sentence spoke;

And more than England honours that,

     Thy famous brother-oak,


Wherein the younger Charles abode

     Till all the paths were dim,

And far below the Roundhead rode,

     And humm'd a surly hymn.

Poem 160: The War

There is a sound of thunder afar,

Storm in the south that darkens the day,

Storm of battle and thunder of war,

Well, if it do not roll our way.

  Form! form! Riflemen form!

  Ready, be ready to meet the storm!

  Riflemen, riflemen, riflemen form!


Be not deaf to the sound that warns!

Be not gull'd by a despot's plea!

Are figs of thistles or grapes of thorns?

How should a despot set men free?

  Form! form! Riflemen form!

  Ready, be ready to meet the storm!

  Riflemen, riflemen, riflemen form!


Let your Reforms for a moment go,

Look to your butts and make good aims.

Better a rotten borough or so,

Than a rotten fleet or a city of flames!

  Form! form! Riflemen form!

  Ready, be ready to meet the storm!

  Riflemen, riflemen, riflemen form!


Form, be ready to do or die!

Form in freedom's name and the Queen's!

True, that we have a faithful ally,

But only the devil knows what he means!

  Form! form! Riflemen form!

  Ready, be ready to meet the storm!

  Riflemen, riflemen, riflemen form!

Poem 161: Tithonus

The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,

         The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,

         Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,

         And after many a summer dies the swan.

         Me only cruel immortality

         Consumes; I wither slowly in thine arms,

         Here at the quiet limit of the world,

         A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream

         The ever-silent spaces of the East,

         Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.

         Alas! for this gray shadow, once a man--

         So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,

         Who madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd

         To his great heart none other than a God!

         I ask'd thee, "Give me immortality."

         Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,

         Like wealthy men who care not how they give.

         But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills,

         And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,

         And tho' they could not end me, left me maim'd

         To dwell in presence of immortal youth,

         Immortal age beside immortal youth,

         And all I was in ashes. Can thy love

         Thy beauty, make amends, tho' even now,

         Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,

         Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears

         To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:

         Why should a man desire in any way

         To vary from the kindly race of men,

         Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance

         Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?


         A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes

         A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.

         Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals

         From any pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,

         And bosom beating with a heart renew'd.

         Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the gloom,

         Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,

         Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team

         Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,

         And shake the darkness from their loosen'd manes,

         And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.

         Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful

         In silence, then before thine answer given

         Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.


         Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,

         And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,

         In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?

         "The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts."


         Ay me! ay me! with what another heart

         In days far-off, and with what other eyes

         I used to watch if I be he that watch'd

         The lucid outline forming round thee; saw

         The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;

         Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood

         Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all

         Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,

         Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm

         With kisses balmier than half-opening buds

         Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd

         Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet,

         Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing,

         While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.


         Yet hold me not for ever in thine East;

         How can my nature longer mix with thine?

         Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold

         Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet

         Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam

         Floats up from those dim fields about the homes

         Of happy men that have the power to die,

         And grassy barrows of the happier dead.

         Release me, and restore me to the ground;

         Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave:

         Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;

         I earth in earth forget these empty courts,

         And thee returning on thy silver wheels.

Poem 162: To E. Fitzgerald: Tiresias

OLD FITZ, who from your suburb grange,

    Where once I tarried for a while,

    Glance at the wheeling orb of change,

    And greet it with a kindly smile;

    Whom yet I see as there you sit

    Beneath your sheltering garden-tree,

    And watch your doves about you flit,

    And plant on shoulder, hand, and knee,

    Or on your head their rosy feet,

    As if they knew your diet spares

    Whatever moved in that full sheet

    Let down to Peter at his prayers;

    Who live on milk and meal and grass;

    And once for ten long weeks I tried

    Your table of Pythagoras,

    - And seem'd at first "a thing enskied,"

    As Shakespeare has it, airy-light

    To float above the ways of men,

    Then fell from that half-spiritual height

    Chill'd, till I tasted flesh again

    One night when earth was winter-black,

    And all the heavens flash'd in frost;

    And on me, half-asleep, came back

    That wholesome heat the blood had lost,

    And set me climbing icy capes

    And glaciers, over which there roll'd

    To meet me long-arm'd vines with grapes

    Of Eshcol hugeness- for the cold

    Without, and warmth within me, wrought

    To mould the dream; but none can say

    That Lenten fare makes Lenten thought

    Who reads your golden Eastern lay,

    Than which I know no version done

    In English more divinely well;

    A planet equal to the sun

    Which cast it, that large infidel

    Your Omar, and your Omar drew

    Full-handed plaudits from our best

    In modern letters, and from two,

    Old friends outvaluing all the rest,

    Two voices heard on earth no more;

    But we old friends are still alive,

    And I am nearing seventy-four,

    While you have touch'd at seventy-five,

    And so I send a birthday line

    Of greeting; and my son, who dipt

    In some forgotten book of mine

    With sallow scraps of manuscript,

    And dating many a year ago,

    Has hit on this, which you will take,

    My Fitz, and welcome, as I know,

    Less for its own than for the sake

    Of one recalling gracious times,

    When, in our younger London days,

    You found some merit in my rhymes,

    And I more pleasure in your praise.


                     TIRESIAS


         I WISH I were as in the years of old

         While yet the blessed daylight made itself

         Ruddy thro' both the roofs of sight, and woke

         These eyes, now dull, but then so keen to seek

         The meanings ambush'd under all they saw,

         The flight of birds, the flame of sacrifice,

         What omens may foreshadow fate to man

         And woman, and the secret of the Gods.

         My son, the Gods, despite of human prayer,

         Are slower to forgive than human kings.

         The great God Ares burns in anger still


         Against the guiltless heirs of him from Tyre

         Our Cadmus, out of whom thou art, who found

         Beside the springs of Dirce, smote, and still'd

         Thro' all its folds the multitudinous beast

         The dragon, which our trembling fathers call'd

         The God's own son.

              A tale, that told to me,

         When but thine age, by age as winter-white

         As mine is now, amazed, but made me yearn

         For larger glimpses of that more than man

         Which rolls the heavens, and lifts and lays the deep,

         Yet loves and hates with mortal hates and loves,

         And moves unseen among the ways of men.

         Then, in my wanderings all the lands that lie

         Subjected to the Heliconian ridge

         Have heard this footstep fall, altho' my wont

         Was more to scale the highest of the heights

         With some strange hope to see the nearer God.

         One naked peak‹the sister of the Sun

         Would climb from out the dark, and linger there



         To silver all the valleys with her shafts‹

         There once, but long ago, five-fold thy term

         Of years, I lay; the winds were dead for heat-

         The noonday crag made the hand burn; and sick

         For shadow‹not one bush was near‹I rose

         Following a torrent till its myriad falls

         Found silence in the hollows underneath.

         There in a secret olive-glade I saw

         Pallas Athene climbing from the bath

         In anger; yet one glittering foot disturb'd

         The lucid well; one snowy knee was prest

         Against the margin flowers; a dreadful light

         Came from her golden hair, her golden helm

         And all her golden armor on the grass,

         And from her virgin breast, and virgin eyes

         Remaining fixt on mine, till mine grew dark

         For ever, and I heard a voice that said

         "Henceforth be blind, for thou hast seen too much,

         And speak the truth that no man may believe."

         Son, in the hidden world of sight that lives

         Behind this darkness, I behold her still

         Beyond all work of those who carve the stone

         Beyond all dreams of Godlike womanhood,

         Ineffable beauty, out of whom, at a glance

         And as it were, perforce, upon me flash'd

         The power of prophesying‹but to me

         No power so chain'd and coupled with the curse

         Of blindness and their unbelief who heard

         And heard not, when I spake of famine, plague

         Shrine-shattering earthquake, fire, flood, thunderbolt,

         And angers of the Gods for evil done

         And expiation lack'd‹no power on Fate

         Theirs, or mine own! for when the crowd would roar

         For blood, for war, whose issue was their doom,

         To cast wise words among the multitude

         Was flinging fruit to lions; nor, in hours

         Of civil outbreak, when I knew the twain

         Would each waste each, and bring on both the yoke

         Of stronger states, was mine the voice to curb

         The madness of our cities and their kings.

         Who ever turn'd upon his heel to hear

         My warning that the tyranny of one

         Was prelude to the tyranny of all?

         My counsel that the tyranny of all

         Led backward to the tyranny of one?

         This power hath work'd no good to aught that lives

         And these blind hands were useless in their wars.

         O. therefore, that the unfulfill'd desire,

         The grief for ever born from griefs to be

         The boundless yearning of the prophet's heart‹

         Could that stand forth, and like a statue, rear'd

         To some great citizen, whim all praise from all

         Who past it, saying, "That was he!"

              In vain!

         Virtue must shape itself in deed, and those

         Whom weakness or necessity have cramp'd

         Within themselves, immerging, each, his urn

         In his own well, draws solace as he may.

         Menceceus, thou hast eyes, and I can hear

         Too plainly what full tides of onset sap

         Our seven high gates, and what a weight of war

         Rides on those ringing axles jingle of bits,

         Shouts, arrows, tramp of the horn-footed horse

         That grind the glebe to powder! Stony showers

         Of that ear-stunning hail of Ares crash

         Along the sounding walls. Above, below

         Shock after shock, the song-built towers and gates

         Reel, bruised and butted with the shuddering

         War-thunder of iron rams; and from within

         The city comes a murmur void of joy,

         Lest she be taken captive‹maidens, wives,

         And mothers with their babblers of the dawn,

         And oldest age in shadow from the night,

         Falling about their shrines before their Gods,

         And wailing, "Save us."


         And they wail to thee!

         These eyeless eyes, that cannot see thine own,

         See this, that only in thy virtue lies

         The saving of our Thebes; for, yesternight,

         To me, the great God Ares, whose one bliss

         Is war and human sacrifice‹himself

         Blood-red from battle, spear and helmet tipt

         With stormy light as on a mast at sea,

         Stood out before a darkness, crying, "Thebes,

         Thy Thebes shall fall and perish, for I loathe

         The seed of Cadmus‹yet if one of these

         By his own hand‹if one of these‹"

         My son, No sound is breathed so potent to coerce,

         And to conciliate, as their names who dare

         For that sweet mother land which gave them birth

         Nobly to do, nobly to die. Their names,

         Graven on memorial columns, are a song

         Heard in the future; few, but more than wall

         And rampart, their examples reach a hand

         Far thro' all years, and everywhere they meet

         And kindle generous purpose, and the strength

         To mould it into action pure as theirs.

         Fairer thy fate than mine, if life's best end

         Be to end well! and thou refusing this,

         Unvenerable will thy memory be

         While men shall move the lips; but if thou dare‹

         Thou, one of these, the race of Cadmus‹then

         No stone is fitted in yon marble girth

         Whose echo shall not tongue thy glorious doom,

         Nor in this pavement but shall ring thy name

         To every hoof that clangs it, and the springs

         Of Dirce laving yonder battle-plain,

         Heard from the roofs by night, will murmur thee

         To thine own Thebes, while Thebes thro' thee shall stand

         Firm-based with all her Gods.

              The Dragon's cave

         Half hid, they tell me, now in flowing vines‹

         Where once he dwelt and whence he roll'd himself

         At dead of night‹thou knowest, and that smooth rock

         Before it, altar-fashion'd, where of late

         The woman-breasted Sphinx, with wings drawn back

         Folded her lion paws, and look'd to Thebes.

         There blanch the bones of whom she slew, and these

         Mixt with her own, because the fierce beast found

         A wiser than herself, and dash'd herself

         Dead in her rage; but thou art wise enough

         Tho' young, to love thy wiser, blunt the curse

         Of Pallas, bear, and tho' I speak the truth

         Believe I speak it, let thine own hand strike

         Thy youthful pulses into rest and quench

         The red God's anger, fearing not to plunge

         Thy torch of life in darkness, rather thou

         Rejoicing that the sun, the moon, the stars

         Send no such light upon the ways of men

         As one great deed.

              Thither, my son, and there

         Thou, that hast never known the embrace of love

         Offer thy maiden life.

              This useless hand!

         I felt one warm tear fall upon it. Gone!

         He will achieve his greatness.

         But for me I would that I were gather'd to my rest,

         And mingled with the famous kings of old

         On whom about their ocean-islets flash

         The faces of the Gods‹the wise man's word

         Here trampled by the populace underfoot

         There crown'd with worship and these eyes will find

         The men I knew, and watch the chariot whirl

         About the goal again, and hunters race

         The shadowy lion, and the warrior-kings

         In height and prowess more than human, strive

         Again for glory, while the golden lyre

         Is ever sounding in heroic ears

         Heroic hymns, and every way the vales

         Wind, clouded with the grateful incense-fume

         Of those who mix all odor to the Gods

         On one far height in one far-shining fire.


         -------------------------


         "One height and one far-shining fire!"

         And while I fancied that my friend

         For this brief idyll would require

         A less diffuse and opulent end,

         And would defend his judgment well,

         If I should deem it over nice‹

         The tolling of his funeral bell

         Broke on my Pagan Paradise,

         And mixt the dream of classic times,

         And all the phantoms of the dream,

         With present grief, and made the rhymes,

         That miss'd his living welcome, seem

         Like would-be guests an hour too late,

         Who down the highway moving on

         With easy laughter find the gate

         Is bolted, and the master gone.

         Gone onto darkness, that full light

         Of friendship! past, in sleep, away

         By night, into the deeper night!

         The deeper night? A clearer day

         Than our poor twilight dawn on earth‹

         If night, what barren toil to be!

         What life, so maim'd by night, were worth

         Our living out? Not mine to me

         Remembering all the golden hours

         Now silent, and so many dead,

         And him the last; and laying flowers,

         This wreath, above his honor'd head,

         And praying that, when I from hence

         Shall fade with him into the unknown,

         My close of earth's experience

         May prove as peaceful as his own.

Poem 163: To J. S.

The wind, that beats the mountain, blows

    More softly round the open wold,

  And gently comes the world to those

    That are cast in gentle mould.

  And me this knowledge bolder made,

    Or else I had not dare to flow

  In these words toward you, and invade

    Even with a verse your holy woe.

  'Tis strange that those we lean on most,

   Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,

 Fall into shadow, soonest lost:

   Those we love first are taken first.


 God gives us love. Something to love

   He lends us; but, when love is grown

 To ripeness, that on which it throve

   Falls off, and love is left alone.


 This is the curse of time. Alas!

   In grief I am not all unlearn'd;

 Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass;

   One went, who never hath return'd.


 He will not smile--not speak to me

   Once more. Two years his chair is seen

 Empty before us. That was he

   Without whose life I had not been.


 Your loss is rarer; for this star

   Rose with you thro' a little arc

 Of heaven, nor having wander'd far

   Shot on the sudden into dark.


 I knew your brother: his mute dust

   I honour and his living worth:

 A man more pure and bold and just

   Was never born into the earth.


 I have not look'd upon you nigh,

   Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.

 Great nature is more wise than I:

   I will not tell you not to weep.


 And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,

   Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain,

 I will not even preach to you,

   "Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain."


 Let Grief be her own mistress still.

   She loveth her own anguish deep

 More than much pleasure. Let her will

   Be done--to weep or not to weep.


 I will not say "God's ordinance

   Of death is blown in every wind;"

 For that is not a common chance

   That takes away a noble mind.


 His memory long will live alone

   In all our hearts, as mournful light

 That broods above the fallen sun,

   And dwells in heaven half the night.


 Vain solace! Memory standing near

   Cast down her eyes, and in her throat

 Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear

   Dropt on the letters as I wrote.


 I wrote I know not what. In truth,

   How should I soothe you anyway,

 Who miss the brother of your youth?

   Yet something I did wish to say:


 For he too was a friend to me:

   Both are my friends, and my true breast

 Bleedeth for both: yet it may be

   That only silence suiteth best.


 Words weaker than your grief would make

   Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;

 Although myself could almost take

   The place of him that sleeps in peace.


 Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace;

   Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,

 While the stars burn, the moons increase,

   And the great ages onward roll.


 Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.

   Nothing comes to thee new or strange,

 Sleep full of rest from head to feet:

   Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.

Poem 164: To The Queen

O loyal to the royal in thyself,

And loyal to thy land, as this to thee--

Bear witness, that rememberable day,

When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince

Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again

From halfway down the shadow of the grave,

Past with thee through thy people and their love,

And London rolled one tide of joy through all

Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man

And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,

The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime--

Thunderless lightnings striking under sea

From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,

And that true North, whereof we lately heard

A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves;

So loyal is too costly! friends--your love

Is but a burthen:  loose the bond, and go.'

Is this the tone of empire? here the faith

That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice

And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont

Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?

What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak

So feebly? wealthier--wealthier--hour by hour!

The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,

Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?

THERE rang her voice, when the full city pealed

Thee and thy Prince!  The loyal to their crown

Are loyal to their own far sons, who love

Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes

For ever-broadening England, and her throne

In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,

That knows not her own greatness:  if she knows

And dreads it we are fallen. --But thou, my Queen,

Not for itself, but through thy living love

For one to whom I made it o'er his grave

Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,

New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,

Ideal manhood closed in real man,

Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,

Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,

And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him

Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one

Touched by the adulterous finger of a time

That hovered between war and wantonness,

And crownings and dethronements:  take withal

Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven

Will blow the tempest in the distance back

From thine and ours:  for some are sacred, who mark,

Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,

Waverings of every vane with every wind,

And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,

And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,

And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,

Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,

Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,

Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,

And that which knows, but careful for itself,

And that which knows not, ruling that which knows

To its own harm:  the goal of this great world

Lies beyond sight:  yet--if our slowly-grown

And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense,

That saved her many times, not fail--their fears

Are morning shadows huger than the shapes

That cast them, not those gloomier which forego

The darkness of that battle in the West,

Where all of high and holy dies away.

Poem 165: To Virgil

Written at the Request of the Mantuans for the Nineteenth Centenary of

Virgil's Death



Roman Virgil, thou that singest

Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire,

Ilion falling, Rome arising,

wars, and filial faith, and Dido's pyre;


Landscape-lover, lord of language

more than he that sang the Works and Days,

All the chosen coin of fancy

flashing out from many a golden phrase;


Thou that singest wheat and woodland,

tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd;

All the charm of all the Muses

often flowering in a lonely word;


Poet of the happy Tityrus

piping underneath his beechen bowers;

Poet of the poet-satyr

whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;


Chanter of the Pollio, glorying

in the blissful years again to be,

Summers of the snakeless meadow,

unlaborious earth and oarless sea;


Thou that seest Universal

Nature moved by Universal Mind;

Thou majestic in thy sadness

at the doubtful doom of human kind;


Light among the vanished ages;

star that gildest yet this phantom shore;

Golden branch amid the shadows,

kings and realms that pass to rise no more;


Now thy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar's dome -

Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Rome -


Now the Rome of slaves hath perished,

and the Rome of freemen holds her place,

I, from out the Northern Island

sundered once from all the human race,


I salute thee, Mantovano,

I that loved thee since my day began,

Wielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.

Poem 166: Ulysses

It little profits that an idle king,

By this still hearth, among these barren crags,

Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole

Unequal laws unto a savage race,

That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.

I cannot rest from travel; I will drink

Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd

Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those

That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when

Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades

Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name;

For always roaming with a hungry heart

Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men

And manners, climates, councils, governments,

Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,--

And drunk delight of battle with my peers,

Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.

I am a part of all that I have met;

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'

Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades

For ever and for ever when I move.

How dull it is to pause, to make an end,

To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!

As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life

Were all too little, and of one to me

Little remains; but every hour is saved

>From that eternal silence, something more,

A bringer of new things; and vile it were

For some three suns to store and hoard myself,

And this gray spirit yearning in desire

To follow knowledge like a sinking star,

Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

This is my son, mine own Telemachus,

to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--

Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill

This labor, by slow prudence to make mild

A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees

Subdue them to the useful and the good.

Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere

Of common duties, decent not to fail

In offices of tenderness, and pay

Meet adoration to my household gods,

When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine.

There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;

There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners,

Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--

That ever with a frolic welcome took

The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed

Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old;

Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.

Death closes all; but something ere the end,

Some work of noble note, may yet be done,

Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.

The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;

The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep

Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends.

'T is not too late to seek a newer world.

Push off, and sitting well in order smite

The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

Of all the western stars, until I die.

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'

We are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--

One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Poem 167: You Ask Me, Why, Tho' Ill at Ease

You ask me, why, tho' ill at ease,

     Within this region I subsist,

     Whose spirits falter in the mist,

   And languish for the purple seas.

    It is the land that freemen till,

     That sober-suited Freedom chose,

     The land, where girt with friends or foes

   A man may speak the thing he will;

    A land of settled government,

    A land of just and old renown,

    Where Freedom slowly broadens down

  From precedent to precedent:


   Where faction seldom gathers head,

    But by degrees to fullness wrought,

    The strength of some diffusive thought

  Hath time and space to work and spread.


   Should banded unions persecute

    Opinion, and induce a time

    When single thought is civil crime,

  And individual freedom mute;


   Tho' Power should make from land to land

    The name of Britain trebly great--

    Tho' every channel of the State

  Should fill and choke with golden sand--


   Yet waft me from the harbour-mouth,

Poem 168: Œnone

There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier

   Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.

   The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen,

   Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,

   And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand

   The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down

   Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars

   The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine

   In cataract after cataract to the sea.

  Behind the valley topmost Gargarus

  Stands up and takes the morning: but in front

  The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal

  Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel,

  The crown of Troas.         Hither came at noon

  Mournful Œnone, wandering forlorn

  Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills.

  Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck

  Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest.

  She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine,

  Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade

  Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff.


  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,

  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  For now the noonday quiet holds the hill:

  The grasshopper is silent in the grass:

  The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,

  Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead.

  The purple flower droops: the golden bee

  Is lily-cradled: I alone awake.

  My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,

  My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim,

  And I am all aweary of my life.


  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,

  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  Hear me, O Earth, hear me, O Hills, O Caves

  That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks,

  I am the daughter of a River-God,

  Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all

  My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls

  Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed,

  A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be

  That, while I speak of it, a little while

  My heart may wander from its deeper woe.


      "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,

  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  I waited underneath the dawning hills,

  Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark,

  And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine:

  Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,

  Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved,

  Came up from reedy Simois all alone.


      "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft:

  Far up the solitary morning smote

  The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes

  I sat alone: white-breasted like a star

  Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin

  Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair

   Cluster'd about his temples like a God's:

  And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens

  When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart

  Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.


      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm

  Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold,

  That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd

  And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech

  Came down upon my heart.      `My own Œnone,

  Beautiful-brow'd Œnone, my own soul,

  Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n

  "For the most fair," would seem to award it thine,

  As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt

  The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace

  Of movement, and the charm of married brows.'


      "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,

  And added 'This was cast upon the board,

  When all the full-faced presence of the Gods

  Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon

  Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:

  But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve,

  Delivering that to me, by common voice

  Elected umpire, Herè comes to-day,

  Pallas and Aphroditè, claiming each

  This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave

  Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,

  Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard

  Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'


  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

  It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud

  Had lost his way between the piney sides

  Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came,

  Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower,

  And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,

  Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,

  Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose,

  And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,

 This way and that, in many a wild festoon

 Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs

 With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.



    "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit,

 And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd

 Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew.

 Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom

 Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows

 Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods

 Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made

 Proffer of royal power, ample rule

 Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue

 Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale

 And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn,

 Or labour'd mine undrainable of ore.

 Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll,

 From many an inland town and haven large,

 Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel

 In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'



    "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 Still she spake on and still she spake of power,

 'Which in all action is the end of all;

 Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred

 And throned of wisdom--from all neighbour crowns

 Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand

 Fail from the sceptre-staff. Such boon from me,

 From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris, to thee king-born,

 A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born,

 Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power

 Only, are likest Gods, who have attain'd

 Rest in a happy place and quiet seats

 Above the thunder, with undying bliss

 In knowledge of their own supremacy.'



    "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit

 Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power

 Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood

 Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs

 O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear

 Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold,

 The while, above, her full and earnest eye

 Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek

 Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.



    "`Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,

 These three alone lead life to sovereign power.

 Yet not for power (power of herself

 Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law,

 Acting the law we live by without fear;

 And, because right is right, to follow right

 Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'



    "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts.

 Sequel of guerdon could not alter me

 To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am,

 So shalt thou find me fairest.          Yet, indeed,

 If gazing on divinity disrobed

 Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair,

 Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure

 That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee,

 So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood,

 Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's,

 To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks,

 Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow

 Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will,

 Circled thro' all experiences, pure law,

 Commeasure perfect freedom.'          Here she ceas'd

 And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris,

 Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,

 Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!



    "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,

 Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 Italian Aphroditè beautiful,

 Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells,

 With rosy slender fingers backward drew

 From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair

 Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat

 And shoulder: from the violets her light foot

 Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form

 Between the shadows of the vine-bunches

 Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.



    "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,

 The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh

 Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee

 The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.'

 She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear:

 But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm,

 And I beheld great Herè's angry eyes,

 As she withdrew into the golden cloud,

 And I was left alone within the bower;

 And from that time to this I am alone,

 And I shall be alone until I die.



    "Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die.

 Fairest--why fairest wife? am I not fair?

 My love hath told me so a thousand times.

 Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,

 When I past by, a wild and wanton pard,

 Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail

 Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?

 Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms

 Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest

 Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew

 Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains

 Flash in the pools of whirling Simois!



    "O mother, hear me yet before I die.

 They came, they cut away my tallest pines,

 My tall dark pines, that plumed the craggy ledge

 High over the blue gorge, and all between

 The snowy peak and snow-white cataract

 Foster'd the callow eaglet--from beneath

 Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn

 The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat

 Low in the valley. Never, never more

 Shall lone Œnone see the morning mist

 Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid

 With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,

 Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.



    "O mother, hear me yet before I die.

 I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds,

 Among the fragments tumbled from the glens,

 Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her

 The Abominable, that uninvited came

 Into the fair Pele{:i}an banquet-hall,

 And cast the golden fruit upon the board,

 And bred this change; that I might speak my mind,

 And tell her to her face how much I hate

 Her presence, hated both of Gods and men.



    "O mother, hear me yet before I die.

 Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,

 In this green valley, under this green hill,

 Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?

 Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears?

 O happy tears, and how unlike to these!

 O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face?

 O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight?

 O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud,

 There are enough unhappy on this earth,

 Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:

 I pray thee, pass before my light of life,

 And shadow all my soul, that I may die.

 Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,

 Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die.



    "O mother, hear me yet before I die.

 I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts

 Do shape themselves within me, more and more,

 Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear

 Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,

 Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see

 My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother

 Conjectures of the features of her child

 Ere it is born: her child!--a shudder comes

 Across me: never child be born of me,

 Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes!



    "O mother, hear me yet before I die.

 Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone,

 Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me

 Walking the cold and starless road of death

 Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love

 With the Greek woman. I will rise and go

 Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth

 Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says

 A fire dances before her, and a sound

 Rings ever in her ears of armed men.

 What this may be I know not, but I know

 That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day,

 All earth and air seem only burning fire.

    He was reading to you all evening, but could you really

make out what he meant?

    What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father

    You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on

    If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me,

"What a naughty child!"

    If I make the slightest noise you say, "Don't you see that

father's at his work?"

    What's the fun of always writing and writing?

    When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book

just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me

then, mother?

    You never say a word when father writes.

    When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't

seem to mind at all.

    But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say,

"Child, how troublesome you are!"

    What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of

paper with black marks all over both sides?

Poem 2: Baby's Way

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.

    It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.

    He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever

bear to lose sight of her.

    Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can

understand their meaning.

    It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.

    The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from

mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.

    Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar

on to this earth.

    It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.

    This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly

helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.

    Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny

crescent moon.

    It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.

    He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little

corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught

and pressed in her dear arms.

    Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect

bliss.

    It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.

    Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's

yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles

weave the double bond of pity and love.

    Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never

could move, come creeping to his window with their stories and with

trays crowded with bright toys.

    I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind,

and out beyond all bounds;

    Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms

of kings of no history;

    Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truth

sets Fact free from its fetters.

Poem 6: Brink Of Eternity

In desperate hope I go and search for her

But infinite is thy mansion, my lord,

and seeking her I have to come to thy door.


I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky

and I lift my eager eyes to thy face.


I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish

---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.


Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean,

plunge it into the deepest fullness.

Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch

in the allness of the universe.

Poem 7: Chain Of Pearls

Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck

with my tears of sorrow.


The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet,

but mine will hang upon thy breast.


Wealth and fame come from thee

and it is for thee to give or to withhold them.

But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own,

and when I bring it to thee as my offering

thou rewardest me with thy grace.

Poem 8: Closed Path

I thought that my voyage had come to its end

at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed,

that provisions were exhausted

and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.


But I find that thy will knows no end in me.

And when old words die out on the tongue,

new melodies break forth from the heart;

and where the old tracks are lost,

new country is revealed with its wonders.

Poem 9: Clouds and Waves

Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-

    "We play from the time we wake till the day ends.

    We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon."

    I ask, "But how am I to get up to you ?"

    They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your

hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."

    "My mother is waiting for me at home, "I say, "How can I leave

her and come?"

    Then they smile and float away.

    But I know a nicer game than that, mother.

    I shall be the cloud and you the moon.

    I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will

be the blue sky.

    The folk who live in the waves call out to me-

    "We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know

not where we pass."

    I ask, "But how am I to join you?"

    They tell me, "Come to the edge of the shore and stand with

your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."

    I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the everything-

how can I leave her and go?"

    They smile, dance and pass by.

    But I know a better game than that.

    I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.

    I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with

laughter.

    And no one in the world will know where we both are.

Poem 10: Colored Toys

When I bring to you colored toys, my child,

I understand why there is such a play of colors on clouds, on water,

and why flowers are painted in tints

---when I give colored toys to you, my child.


When I sing to make you dance

I truly now why there is music in leaves,

and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth

---when I sing to make you dance.


When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands

I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers

and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice

---when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.


When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling,

I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light,

and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body

---when I kiss you to make you smile.

O thou the last fulfilment of life,

Death, my death, come and whisper to me!


Day after day I have kept watch for thee;

All that I am, that I have, that I hope and all my love

have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy.


One final glance from thine eyes

and my life will be ever thine own.


The flowers have been woven

and the garland is ready for the bridegroom.


After the wedding the bride shall leave her home

Where are those tears in your eyes, my child?

    O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because

    You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you

untidy?

    O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles

through its ragged clouds?

    Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.

We have no time to lose,

We are too poor to be late.


And thus it is that time goes by

At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut;

Poem 17: Fairyland

If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish

into the air.

    The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.

    The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she

wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.

    But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's

palace is.

    It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi

plant stands.

    The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven

impassable seas.

    There is none in the world who can find her but myself.

    She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her

hair sweeps down upon the floor.

    She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels

will fall from her lips when she smiles.

    But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the

corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.

    When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step

up to that terrace on the roof.

    I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet

together.

    Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the

barber in the story lives.

    But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in

the story lives.

you fasten yourself in night's stillness,

mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;

freedom from the anarchy of destiny

whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,

and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.

Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,

where movements are started through brainless wires,

repeated through mindless habits,

where figures wait with patience and obedience for the

Poem 25: Gitanjali

1.


Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.


This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.


At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.


Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.



2.


When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.


All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony - and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.


I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.


I touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach.


Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.



3.


I know not how thou singest, my master! I ever listen in silent amazement.


The light of thy music illumines the world. The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky. The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on.


My heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled. Ah, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music, my master!



4.


Life of my life, I shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs.


I shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind.


I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart.


And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act.

I ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards.


Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.


Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove.


Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure.

Pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it droop and drop into the dust.

The child who is decked with prince's robes and who has jewelled chains round his neck loses all pleasure in his play; his dress hampers him at every step.


In fear that it may be frayed, or stained with dust he keeps himself from the world, and is afraid even to move.


Mother, it is no gain, thy bondage of finery, if it keeps one shut off from the healthful dust of the earth, if it rob one of the right of entrance to the great fair of common human life.

Here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.


When I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.


Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.


My heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost.

Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!


He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put of thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!


Deliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found? Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us all for ever.


Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.

The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.


I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet.


It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.


The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end.


My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said 'Here art thou!'


The question and the cry 'Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance 'I am!'

The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.


The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart.


The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.


The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house.


I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.

My desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.


Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked - this sky and the light, this body and the life and the mind - saving me from perils of overmuch desire.


There are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.


Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.

I am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner seat.


In thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose.


When the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing.


When in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding my presence.

I have had my invitation to this world's festival, and thus my life has been blessed. My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.


It was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument, and I have done all I could.


Now, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my silent salutation?

I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands. That is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions.


They come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast; but I evade them ever, for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.


People blame me and call me heedless; I doubt not they are right in their blame.


The market day is over and work is all done for the busy. Those who came to call me in vain have gone back in anger. I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.

Clouds heap upon clouds and it darkens. Ah, love, why dost thou let me wait outside at the door all alone?


In the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd, but on this dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope.


If thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I know not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.


I keep gazing on the far-away gloom of the sky, and my heart wanders wailing with the restless wind.



19.


If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience.


The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.


Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.


Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.


That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.


I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.

I must launch out my boat. The languid hours pass by on the shore - Alas for me!


The spring has done its flowering and taken leave. And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger.


The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall.


What emptiness do you gaze upon! Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the far-away song floating from the other shore?



22.


In the deep shadows of the rainy July, with secret steps, thou walkest, silent as night, eluding all watchers.


Today the morning has closed its eyes, heedless of the insistent calls of the loud east wind, and a thick veil has been drawn over the ever-wakeful blue sky.


The woodlands have hushed their songs, and doors are all shut at every house. Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street. Oh my only friend, my best beloved, the gates are open in my house - do not pass by like a dream.



23.


Art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love, my friend? The sky groans like one in despair.


I have no sleep tonight. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend!


I can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path!


By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?



24.


If the day is done, if birds sing no more, if the wind has flagged tired, then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.


From the traveller, whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended, whose garment is torn and dustladen, whose strength is exhausted, remove shame and poverty, and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night.



25.


In the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without struggle, resting my trust upon thee.


Let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship.


It is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening.


26.


He came and sat by my side but I woke not. What a cursed sleep it was, O miserable me!


He came when the night was still; he had his harp in his hands, and my dreams became resonant with its melodies.


Alas, why are my nights all thus lost? Ah, why do I ever miss his sight whose breath touches my sleep?



27.


Light, oh where is the light? Kindle it with the burning fire of desire!


There is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame - is such thy fate, my heart? Ah, death were better by far for thee!


Misery knocks at thy door, and her message is that thy lord is wakeful, and he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night.


The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless. I know not what this is that stirs in me - I know not its meaning.


A moment's flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight, and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me.


Light, oh where is the light! Kindle it with the burning fire of desire! It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void. The night is black as a black stone. Let not the hours pass by in the dark. Kindle the lamp of love with thy life.

Obstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break them.


Freedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed.


I am certain that priceless wealth is in thee, and that thou art my best friend, but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that fills my room.


The shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death; I hate it, yet hug it in love.


My debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted.

I came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me in the silent dark?


I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not.


He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter.


He is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company.

'Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?'


'It was my master,' said the prisoner. 'I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bad that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.'


'Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?'


'It was I,' said the prisoner, 'who forged this chain very carefully. I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.'



32.


By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free.


Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and thou art not seen.


If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart, thy love for me still waits for my love.

When it was day they came into my house and said, 'We shall only take the smallest room here.'


They said, 'We shall help you in the worship of your God and humbly accept only our own share in his grace'; and then they took their seat in a corner and they sat quiet and meek.


But in the darkness of night I find they break into my sacred shrine, strong and turbulent, and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from God's altar.



34.


Let only that little be left of me whereby I may name thee my all.


Let only that little be left of my will whereby I may feel thee on every side, and come to thee in everything, and offer to thee my love every moment.


Let only that little be left of me whereby I may never hide thee.


Let only that little of my fetters be left whereby I am bound with thy will, and thy purpose is carried out in my life - and that is the fetter of thy love.

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action- Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.



36.


This is my prayer to thee, my lord - strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart. Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows. Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service. Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might. Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.



37.


I thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power, - that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.


But I find that thy will knows no end in me. And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders.



38.


That I want thee, only thee - let my heart repeat without end. All desires that distract me, day and night, are false and empty to the core.


As the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry - 'I want thee, only thee'.


As the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is - 'I want thee, only thee'.



39.


When the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy.


When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song.


When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.


When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.


When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.



40.


The rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart. The horizon is fiercely naked - not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower.


Send thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.


But call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.


Let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father's wrath.



41.


Where dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the shadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee for naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee, while passers-by come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is nearly empty.


The morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.


Oh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou hast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart.


I sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming - all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze.


But time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot. Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory. Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?



42.


Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.


In that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words.


Is the time not come yet? Are there works still to do? Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests.


Who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?



43.


The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life.


And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.


Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star.



44.


This is my delight, thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer.


Messengers, with tidings from unknown skies, greet me and speed along the road. My heart is glad within, and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet.


From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, and I know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see.


In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise.



45.


Have you not heard his silent steps? He comes, comes, ever comes.


Every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes.


Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, 'He comes, comes, ever comes.'


In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes.


In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes.


In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine.




-----------------------




46.


I know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me. Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye.


In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret.


I know not only why today my life is all astir, and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart.


It is as if the time were come to wind up my work, and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence.



47.


The night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain. I fear lest in the morning he suddenly come to my door when I have fallen asleep wearied out. Oh friends, leave the way open to him - forbid him not.


If the sounds of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, I pray. I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of birds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light. Let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door.


Ah, my sleep, precious sleep, which only waits for his touch to vanish. Ah, my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of sleep.


Let him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all forms. The first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his glance. And let my return to myself be immediate return to him.



48.


The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed.


We sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pave more and more as the time sped by.


The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.


My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. All honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation - in the shadow of a dim delight.


The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. I forgot for what I had travelled, and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.


At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!



49.


You came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door.


I was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear. You came down and stood at my cottage door.


Masters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours. But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door.


50.


I had gone a-begging from door to door in the village path, when thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and I wondered who was this King of all kings!


My hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end, and I stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on all sides in the dust.


The chariot stopped where I stood. Thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had come at last. Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say 'What hast thou to give to me?'


Ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! I was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee.


But how great my surprise when at the day's end I emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap. I bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all.



51.


The night darkened. Our day's works had been done. We thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut. Only some said the king was to come. We laughed and said 'No, it cannot be!'


It seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind. We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said, 'It is the messenger!' We laughed and said 'No, it must be the wind!'


There came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled us in our sleep. Only some said it was the sound of wheels. We said in a drowsy murmur, 'No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!'


The night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came 'Wake up! delay not!' We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear. Some said, 'Lo, there is the king's flag!' We stood up on our feet and cried 'There is no time for delay!'


The king has come - but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is the throne to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the decorations? Someone has said, 'Vain is this cry! Greet him with empty hands, lead him into thy rooms all bare!'


Open the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! in the depth of the night has come the king of our dark, dreary house. The thunder roars in the sky. The darkness shudders with lightning. Bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard. With the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night.



52.


I thought I should ask of thee - but I dared not - the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two.


Ah me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water. It is thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed. The morning bird twitters and asks, 'Woman, what hast thou got?' No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water - it is thy dreadful sword.


I sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no place to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts me when press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine.


From now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife. Thou hast left death for my companion and I shall crown him with my life. Thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the world.


From now I leave off all petty decorations. Lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour. Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment. No more doll's decorations for me!



53.


Beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with stars and cunningly wrought in myriad-coloured jewels. But more beautiful to me thy sword with its curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of Vishnu, perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset.


It quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the final stroke of death; it shines like the pure flame of being burning up earty sense with one fierce flash.


Beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with starry gems; but thy sword, O lord of thunder, is wrought with uttermost beauty, terrible to behold or think of.



54.


I asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear. When thou took'st thy leave I stood silent. I was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim. They called me and shouted, 'Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.' But I languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings.


I heard not thy steps as thou camest. Thine eyes were sad when they fell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low - 'Ah, I am a thirsty traveller.' I started up from my day-dreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms. The leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark, and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road.


I stood speecess with shame when my name thou didst ask. Indeed, what had I done for thee to keep me in remembrance? But the memory that I could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness. The morning hour is late, the bird sings in weary notes, neem leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and think.


55.


Languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes.


Has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns? Wake, oh awaken! let not the time pass in vain!


At the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude, my friend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken!


What if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun - what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst -


Is there no joy in the deep of your heart? At every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?



56.


Thus it is that thy joy in me is so full. Thus it is that thou hast come down to me. O thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if I were not?


Thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth. In my heart is the endless play of thy delight. In my life thy will is ever taking shape.


And for this, thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart. And for this thy love loses itself in the love of thy lover, and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two.



57.


Light, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light, heart-sweetening light!


Ah, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth.


The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light.


The light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion.


Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure. The heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad.



58.


Let all the strains of joy mingle in my last song - the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that sets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world, the joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life with laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust, and knows not a word.



59.


Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, O beloved of my heart - this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead.


The morning light has flooded my eyes - this is thy message to my heart. Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet.



60.


On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.


They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.


They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.


The sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach.


On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the patess sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.



61.


The sleep that flits on baby's eyes - does anybody know from where it comes? Yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where, in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glow-worms, there hang two timid buds of enchantment. From there it comes to kiss baby's eyes.


The smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps - does anybody know where it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning - the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps.


The sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby's limbs - does anybody know where it was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love - the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby's limbs.



62.


When I bring to you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in tints - when I give coloured toys to you, my child.


When I sing to make you dance I truly now why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth - when I sing to make you dance.


When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice - when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.


When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body - when I kiss you to make you smile.



63.


Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger.


I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forget that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.


Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar.


When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of many.



64.


On the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her, 'Maiden, where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle? My house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light!' she raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk. 'I have come to the river,' she said, 'to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west.' I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.


In the silence of gathering night I asked her, 'Maiden, your lights are all lit - then where do you go with your lamp? My house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light.' She raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful. 'I have come,' she said at last, 'to dedicate my lamp to the sky.' I stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void.


In the moonless gloom of midnight I ask her, 'Maiden, what is your quest, holding the lamp near your heart? My house is all dark and lonesome- - lend me your light.' She stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark. 'I have brought my light,' she said, 'to join the carnival of lamps.' I stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights.



65.


What divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup of my life?


My poet, is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to stand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal harmony?


Thy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to them. Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own entire sweetness in me.



66.


She who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning light, will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song.


Words have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain.


I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life.


Over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart.


many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair.


There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.



67.


Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well.


O thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours.


There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth.


And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.


But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.



68.


Thy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds made of my tears and sighs and songs.


With fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of misty cloud, turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring it with hues everchanging.


It is so light and so fleeting, tender and tearful and dark, that is why thou lovest it, O thou spotless and serene. And that is why it may cover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows.



69.


The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.


It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.


It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow.


I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.



70.


Is it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm? to be tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy?


All things rush on, they stop not, they look not behind, no power can hold them back, they rush on.


Keeping steps with that restless, rapid music, seasons come dancing and pass away - colours, tunes, and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment.



71.


That I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, thus casting coloured shadows on thy radiance - such is thy maya.


Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken body in me.


The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloured tears and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams break and form. In me is thy own defeat of self.


This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day. Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of straightness.


The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.



72.


He it is, the innermost one, who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches.


He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain.


He it is who weaves the web of this maya in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green, and lets peep out through the folds his feet, at whose touch I forget myself.


Days come and ages pass, and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name, in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow.



73.


Deliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.


Thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim.


My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple.


No, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight.


Yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.



74.


The day is no more, the shadow is upon the earth. It is time that I go to the stream to fill my pitcher.


The evening air is eager with the sad music of the water. Ah, it calls me out into the dusk. In the lonely lane there is no passer-by, the wind is up, the ripples are rampant in the river.


I know not if I shall come back home. I know not whom I shall chance to meet. There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays upon his lute.



75.


Thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee undiminished.


The river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and hamlets; yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy feet.


The flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is to offer itself to thee.


Thy worship does not impoverish the world.


From the words of the poet men take what meanings please them; yet their last meaning points to thee.



76.


Day after day, O lord of my life, shall I stand before thee face to face. With folded hands, O lord of all worlds, shall I stand before thee face to face.


Under thy great sky in solitude and silence, with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face.


In this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil and with struggle, among hurrying crowds shall I stand before thee face to face.


And when my work shall be done in this world, O King of kings, alone and speecess shall I stand before thee face to face.



77.


I know thee as my God and stand apart - I do not know thee as my own and come closer. I know thee as my father and bow before thy feet- I do not grasp thy hand as my friend's.


I stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine, there to clasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade.


Thou art the Brother amongst my brothers, but I heed them not, I divide not my earnings with them, thus sharing my all with thee.


In pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand by thee. I shrink to give up my life, and thus do not plunge into the great waters of life.



78.


When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first splendour, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang 'Oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!'


But one cried of a sudden - 'It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost.'


The golden string of their harp snapped, their song stopped, and they cried in dismay - 'Yes, that lost star was the best, she was the glory of all heavens!'


From that day the search is unceasing for her, and the cry goes on from one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy!


Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves - 'Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'



79.


If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.


As my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands grow full with the daily profits, let me ever feel that I have gained nothing - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.


When I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, when I spread my bed low in the dust, let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me - let me not forget a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.


When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound and the laughter there is loud, let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.



80.


I am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky, O my sun ever-glorious! Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour, making me one with thy light, and thus I count months and years separated from thee.


If this be thy wish and if this be thy play, then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, paint it with colours, gild it with gold, float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders.


And again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, I shall melt and vanish away in the dark, or it may be in a smile of the white morning, in a coolness of purity transparent.



81.


On many an idle day have I grieved over lost time. But it is never lost, my lord. Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands.


Hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness.


I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. In the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers.



82.


Time is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes.


Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.


Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.


We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chances. We are too poor to be late.


And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.


At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I find that yet there is time.



83.


Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow.


The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will hang upon thy breast.


Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace.



84.


It is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky.


It is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July.


It is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into sufferings and joy in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poet's heart.



85.


When the warriors came out first from their master's hall, where had they hid their power? Where were their armour and their arms?


They looked poor and helpless, and the arrows were showered upon them on the day they came out from their master's hall.


When the warriors marched back again to their master's hall where did they hide their power?


They had dropped the sword and dropped the bow and the arrow; peace was on their foreheads, and they had left the fruits of their life behind them on the day they marched back again to their master's hall.

Death, thy servant, is at my door. He has crossed the unknown sea and brought thy call to my home.


The night is dark and my heart is fearful - yet I will take up the lamp, open my gates and bow to him my welcome. It is thy messenger who stands at my door.


I will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart.


He will go back with his errand done, leaving a dark shadow on my morning; and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my last offering to thee.


87.


In desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my room; I find her not.


My house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained.


But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, and seeking her I have to come to thy door.


I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and I lift my eager eyes to thy face.


I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish - no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.


Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, plunge it into the deepest fullness. Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of the universe.



88.


Deity of the ruined temple! The broken strings of Vina sing no more your praise. The bells in the evening proclaim not your time of worship. The air is still and silent about you.


In your desolate dwelling comes the vagrant spring breeze. It brings the tidings of flowers - the flowers that for your worship are offered no more.


Your worshipper of old wanders ever longing for favour still refused. In the eventide, when fires and shadows mingle with the gloom of dust, he wearily comes back to the ruined temple with hunger in his heart.


Many a festival day comes to you in silence, deity of the ruined temple. Many a night of worship goes away with lamp unlit.


Many new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the holy stream of oblivion when their time is come.


Only the deity of the ruined temple remains unworshipped in deatess neglect.


89.


No more noisy, loud words from me - such is my master's will. Henceforth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.


Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.


Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.


Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!



90.


On the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to him?


Oh, I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life - I will never let him go with empty hands.


All the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights, all the earnings and gleanings of my busy life will I place before him at the close of my days when death will knock at my door.



91.


O thou the last fulfilment of life, Death, my death, come and whisper to me!


Day after day I have kept watch for thee; for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life.


All that I am, that I have, that I hope and all my love have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy. One final glance from thine eyes and my life will be ever thine own.


The flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the bridegroom. After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night.



92.


I know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be lost, and life will take its leave in silence, drawing the last curtain over my eyes.


Yet stars will watch at night, and morning rise as before, and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.


When I think of this end of my moments, the barrier of the moments breaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless treasures. Rare is its lowliest seat, rare is its meanest of lives.


Things that I longed for in vain and things that I got - let them pass. Let me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked.



93.


I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all and take my departure.


Here I give back the keys of my door - and I give up all claims to my house. I only ask for last kind words from you.


We were neighbours for long, but I received more than I could give. Now the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. A summons has come and I am ready for my journey.



94.


At this time of my parting, wish me good luck, my friends! The sky is flushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful.


Ask not what I have with me to take there. I start on my journey with empty hands and expectant heart.


I shall put on my wedding garland. Mine is not the red-brown dress of the traveller, and though there are dangers on the way I have no fear in mind.


The evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the King's gateway.


95.


I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life.


What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight!


When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother.


Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well.


The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away, in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.



96.


When I go from hence let this be my parting word, that what I have seen is unsurpassable.


I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus am I blessed - let this be my parting word.


In this playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I caught sight of him that is formless.


My whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch; and if the end comes here, let it come - let this be my parting word.



97.


When my play was with thee I never questioned who thou wert. I knew nor shyness nor fear, my life was boisterous.


In the early morning thou wouldst call me from my sleep like my own comrade and lead me running from glade to glade.


On those days I never cared to know the meaning of songs thou sangest to me. Only my voice took up the tunes, and my heart danced in their cadence.


Now, when the playtime is over, what is this sudden sight that is come upon me? The world with eyes bent upon thy feet stands in awe with all its silent stars.



98.


I will deck thee with trophies, garlands of my defeat. It is never in my power to escape unconquered.


I surely know my pride will go to the wall, my life will burst its bonds in exceeding pain, and my empty heart will sob out in music like a hollow reed, and the stone will melt in tears.


I surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared.


From the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence. Nothing will be left for me, nothing whatever, and utter death shall I receive at thy feet.



99.


When I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take it. What there is to do will be instantly done. Vain is this struggle.


Then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed.


These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them I forget all else again and again.


But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here.



100.


I dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless.


No more sailing from harbour to harbour with this my weather-beaten boat. The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves.


And now I am eager to die into the deatess.


Into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the music of toneless strings I shall take this harp of my life.


I shall tune it to the notes of forever, and when it has sobbed out its last utterance, lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent.



101.


Ever in my life have I sought thee with my songs. It was they who led me from door to door, and with them have I felt about me, searching and touching my world.


It was my songs that taught me all the lessons I ever learnt; they showed me secret paths, they brought before my sight many a star on the horizon of my heart.


They guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of pleasure and pain, and, at last, to what palace gate have the brought me in the evening at the end of my journey?



102.


I boasted among men that I had known you. They see your pictures in all works of mine. They come and ask me, 'Who is he?' I know not how to answer them. I say, 'Indeed, I cannot tell.' They blame me and they go away in scorn. And you sit there smiling.


I put my tales of you into lasting songs. The secret gushes out from my heart. They come and ask me, 'Tell me all your meanings.' I know not how to answer them. I say, 'Ah, who knows what they mean!' They smile and go away in utter scorn. And you sit there smiling.



103.


In one salutation to thee, my God, let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet.


Like a rain-cloud of July hung low with its burden of unshed showers let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee.


Let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee.


Like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their mountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in one salutation to thee.

Poem 27: Hard Times

Music is silenced, the dark descending slowly

Has stripped unending skies of all companions.

Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons

Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears.

Still, O bird, O sightless bird,

Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.



It's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls

Of an ocean's drowsy booming,

Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam.

Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves?

Where the nest and the branch's hold?

Still, O bird, my sightless bird,

Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


Stretching in front of you the night's immensity

Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun;

Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming

Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon

Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon.

--But O my bird, O sightless bird,

Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.



From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers

Intently watch your course and death's impatience

Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves;

And sad entreaties line the farthest shore

With hands outstretched and crooning 'Come, O come!'

Still, O bird, O sightless bird,

Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.



All that is past: your fears and loves and hopes;

All that is lost: your words and lamentation;

No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers.

For wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard,

And the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction.

Dear bird, my sightless bird,

Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!

Poem 28: I

I wonder if I know him

In whose speech is my voice,

In whose movement is my being,

Whose skill is in my lines,

Whose melody is in my songs

In joy and sorrow.

I thought he was chained within me,

Contained by tears and laughter,

Work and play.

I thought he was my very self

Coming to an end with my death.

Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him

In the sight and touch of my beloved?

This 'I' beyond self I found

On the shores of the shining sea.

Therefore I know

This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds.

Losing myself, I find him

Beyond the borders of time and space.

Through the Ages

I come to know his Shining Self

In the Iffe of the seeker,

In the voice of the poet.

From the dark clouds pour the rains.

I sit and think:

Bearing so many forms, so many names,

I come down, crossing the threshold

Of countless births and deaths.

The Supreme undivided, complete in himself,

Embracing past and present,

Dwells in Man.

Within Him I shall find myself -

The 'I' that reaches everywhere.

in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green,

The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own,

The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless.

I know not what this is that stirs in me---I know not its meaning.

I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,

And with the molten gold of my desires

I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours.

I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,

Lord of my life.


Didst thou store my days and nights,

my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,

and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,

and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?


I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,

Lord of my life,

I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven.

For many were my days without service

and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers

that faded in the shade not offered to thee.


Often the tied strings of my lute slackened

at the strains of thy tunes.

And often at the ruin of wasted hours

my desolate evenings were filled with tears.


But have my days come to their end at last,

Lord of my life, while my arms round thee

Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;

for forms. They are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light,

Poem 48: Lover's Gifts LXX: Take Back Your Coins

Take back your coins, King's Councillor. I am of those women you

sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never

seen a women. I failed in your bidding.

    Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in

the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a

cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of

sunbeam. We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped

into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun

rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine

anger.

    Like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our

movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning

stars. He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in

his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest.

Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like

the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. The

women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with

laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. Quickly came

I to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, I said,

"Lord, accept my service."

    I led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of

my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, I dried his feet

with my trailing hair. When I raised my face and looked into his

eyes, I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman,

-Blessed am I, blessed is God, who made me a woman. I heard him say

to me, "What God unknown are you? Your touch is the touch of the

Immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight."

    Ah, no, not that smile, King's Councillor, -the dust of

worldly  wisdom has covered your sight, old man. But this boy's

innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman

divine....

    The women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene

laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose

they began to pelt him with flowers.

    Alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to

cover you in its folds? I fell at his feet and cried, "Forgive me.

" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as

I fled, " Forgive me. " The women's foul laughter pressed me like

a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, " What God

unknown are you?"

    To-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to

God's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of

flowers in your hand. I stand aside in the shade under the tree,

with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to

the temple.

Poem 52: Lover's Gifts XIL: There Is a Looker-On

There is a looker-on who sits behind my eyes. It seems he has seen

things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore, and those

forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves. He

has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved, in twilight

hours of many a nameless star. Therefore his sky seems to ache with

the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades

this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of

ages without beginning.

Poem 53: Lover's Gifts XIX: It Is Written in the Book

It is written in the book that Man, when fifty, must leave the

noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. But the poet proclaims

that the forest hermitage is only for the young. For it is the

birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden

hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. There

the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has

its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty.

    And alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is

but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the

young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe

discipline of courting.

Poem 54: Lover's Gifts XL: A Message Came

A message came from my youth of vanished days, saying, " I wait for

and hours ache with songs unsung."

    It says, "Come to me across the worn-out track of age, through

the gates of death. For dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered

fruits of the year decay, but I am the eternal truth, and you shall

meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to

Poem 55: Lover's Gifts XLII: Are You a Mere Picture

Are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as

this dust? They throb with the pulse of things, but you are

immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form.

    The day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your

limbs singing of life. My world found its speech in your voice, and

touched my heart with your face. You suddenly stopped in your walk,

in the shadow-side of the Forever, and I went on alone.

    Life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it

runs; it beckons me on, I follow the unseen; but you stand there,

where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a

mere picture.

    No, it cannot be. Had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,

it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in

her cadence of colours. Had the glimmering dusk of your hair

vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would

die with its dreams.

    Can it be true that I forgot you? We haste on without heed,

forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. Yet they breathe

unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. You have

moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and

therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.

    You are no longer before my songs, but one with them. You came

to me with the first ray of dawn. I lost you with the last gold of

evening. Ever since I am always finding you through the dark. No,

you are no mere picture.

united in me in a marriage bond.

    I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your

My world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding

space, and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust.

Heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body, my child, in your

Poem 59: Lover's Gifts XLVIII: I Travelled the Old Road

I travelled the old road every day, I took my fruits to the market,

my cattle to the meadows, I ferried my boat across the stream and

all the ways were well known to me.

    One morning my basket was heavy with wares. Men were busy in

the fields, the pastures crowded with cattle; the breast of earth

heaved with the mirth of ripening rice.

    Suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to

kiss me on my forehead. My mind started up like the morning out of

mist.

    I forgot to follow the track. I stepped a few paces from the

path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower

I had only known in bud.

    My everyday wisdom was ashamed. I went astray in the fairyland

of things. It was the best luck of my life that I lost my path that

morning, and found my eternal childhood.

Poem 60: Lover's Gifts XVI: She Dwelt Here by the Pool

She dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins. Many

an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of

bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth

had come to her over the young shoots of rice.

    Her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and

in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their

winter quilts. The water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory

of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day

after day, on the footpath leading to the village.

    The women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have

all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking

his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to

greet her.

    Many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller

takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to

yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice

this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined

landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom I love.

Poem 62: Lover's Gifts XXII: I Shall Gladly Suffer

I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,

if only in some happy future I am born a herd-boy in the Brinda

forest.

    The herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan

tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to

splash and plunge in the Jamuna's cool deep stream.

    He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all

the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of

dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the

courtyard to milk the king.

    As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk

gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the

turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails

outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds.

    When the April night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he

disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the

swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind

throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks

of the blue river.

    No, I will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of

new Bengal; I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for

the benighted. If only I could be born, under the shady asoka

groves, in some village of Brinda, where milk is churned by the

But we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss

Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs

brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.

Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:

whomever I see that instant I fall in love with.

for your sake such miles have I traversed!'

All those others who came close and moved off

Poem 71: One Day in Spring...

One day in spring, a woman came

In my lonely woods,

In the lovely form of the Beloved.

Came, to give to my songs, melodies,

To give to my dreams, sweetness.

Suddenly a wild wave

Broke over my heart's shores

And drowned all language.

To my lips no name came,

She stood beneath the tree, turned,

Glanced at my face, made sad with pain,

And with quick steps, came and sat by me.

Taking my hands in hers, she said:

'You do not know me, nor I you--

I wonder how this could be?'

I said:

'We two shall build, a bridge for ever

Between two beings, each to the other unknown,

This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'


The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;

The thread with which she binds me binds her too.

Her have I sought everywhere,

Her have I worshipped within me,

Hidden in that worship she has sought me too.

Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.

She forgot to return, having lost her own.

Her own charms play traitor to her,

She spreads her net, knowing not

Whether she will catch or be caught.

    The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango

grove.

from baby's eyes, flew away.

scowling stones, trickles a tiny stream.

pigeons coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the

stillness of starry nights.

    In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the

bamboo forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask

What there is to do will be instantly done.

Vain is this struggle.


Then take away your hands

and silently put up with your defeat, my heart,

and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still

where you are placed.


These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind,

and trying to light them I forget all else again and again.


But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark,

spreading my mat on the floor;

and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord,

come silently and take thy seat here.

Poem 93: Stream Of Life

The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day

runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.


It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth

in numberless blades of grass

and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.


It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth

and of death, in ebb and in flow.


I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.

And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.

Poem 94: Strong Mercy

My desires are many and my cry is pitiful,

but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals;

and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.


Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple,

great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the

life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire.


There are times when I languidly linger

and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal;

but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.


Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by

refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.

Poem 95: Superior

Mother, your baby is silly! She is so absurdly childish!

    She does not know the difference between the lights in the

streets and the stars.

    When we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real

food, and tries to put them into her mouth.

    When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,

c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at

nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson.

    When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call

her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.

    Everybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call

aloud "Father," she looks about her in excitement and thinks that

father is near.

    When I hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man

brings to carry away the clothes and I warn her that I am the

schoolmaster, she will scream for no reason and call me dada.

    Your baby wants to catch the moon. She is so funny; she calls

Ganesh Ganush.

If I were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would

    Then go, mother, go! I will never come to you when you call

me, and never let you feed me any more.

    If I were only a little green parrot, and not your baby,

    Would you shake your finger at me and say, "What an ungrateful

wretch of a bird! It is gnawing at its chain day and night?"

Poem 98: The Banyan Tree

O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,

have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have

nested in your branches and left you?

    Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at

the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?

    The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your

huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling

to wake up.

    Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles

weaving golden tapestry.

    Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and

the child would sit still and think.

    He longed to be the wind and blow through your resting

branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,

to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like

those ducks among the weeds and shadows.

Poem 99: The Beginning

"Where have I come from, where did you pick me up?" the baby asked

baby to her breast-

    "You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.

    You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with

clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made the unmade

you then.

    You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship

I worshipped you.

    In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my

mother you have lived.

    In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have

been nursed for ages.

    When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered

as a fragrance about it.

    Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow

in the sky before the sunrise.

    Heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you

have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you

have stranded on my heart.

    As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong

to all have become mine.

    For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What

magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of

danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?

    You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I should laugh to

myself and keep quite quiet.

    When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,

you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court

where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the

flower, but not know that it cane from me.

    When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading

ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,

I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,

just where you were reading.

    But  would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your

    When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted

lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and

lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.

    Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines

that I held in my hands when I was a child.

    Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with

merrymakers on festival nights.

    On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.

where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.

    Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.

    They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to

come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand

in a corner.

    When the rain come they have their holidays.

    Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle

in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the

flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.

    Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars

are.

    Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the

riverside pasture;

    Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the

jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds.

    Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman

    They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank.

    Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and

thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their

eggs;

    Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny

footprints upon the clean soft mud;

    Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while

flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.

    Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman

I shall come running to you, saying, "Mother, I am hungry."

Poem 123: The Gardener XI: Come As You Are

Come as you are; do not loiter over

your toilet.

    If your braided hair has loosened if

the parting of your hair be not straight,

if the ribbons of your bodice be not

fastened, do not mind.

    Come as you are; do not loiter over

your toilet.

    Come, with quick steps over the

grass.

    If the raddle come from your feet

because of the dew, of the rings of bells

upon your feet slacken, if pearls drop

out of your chain, do not mind.

    Come, with quick steps over the

grass.

    Do you see the clouds wrapping the

sky?

    Flocks of cranes fly up from the

further river-bank and fitful gusts of

wind rush over the heath.

    The anxious cattle run to their stalls

in the village.

    Do you see the clouds wrapping the

sky?

    In vain you light your toilet lamp

--it flickers and goes out in the

wind.

    Who can know that your eyelids

have not been touched with lamp-

black? For your eyes are darker

than rain-clouds.

    In vain you light your toilet lamp--

it goes out.

    Come as you are; do not loiter over

your toilet.

    If the wreath is not woven, who

cares; if the wrist-chain had not been

linked, let it be.

    Come as you are; do not loiter over

Poem 124: The Gardener XIII: I Asked Nothing

I asked nothing, only stood at the

edge of the wood behind the tree.

    Languor was still upon the eyes

of the dawn, and the dew in the air.

    The lazy smell of the damp grass

hung in the thin mist above the earth.

    Under the banyan tree you were

milking the cow with your hands,

tender and fresh as butter.

    And I was standing still.

    I did not say a word. It was the

bird that sang unseen from the thicket.

    The mango tree was shedding its

flowers upon the village road, and the

bees came humming one by one.

    On the side of the pond the gate of

Shiva's temple was opened and the

worshipper had begun his chants.

    With the vessel on your lap you

were milking the cow.

    I stood with my empty can.

    I did not come near you.

    The sky woke with the sound of

the gong at the temple.

    The dust was raised in the road

from the hoofs of the driven cattle.

    With the gurgling pitchers at their

hips, women came from the river.

    Your bracelets were jingling, and

foam brimming over the jar.

    The morning wore on and I did not

come near you.

Poem 125: The Gardener XIV: I Was Walking by the Road

I was walking by the road, I do not

know why, when the noonday was past

and bamboo branches rustled in the

wind.

    The prone shadows with their out-

stretched arms clung to the feet of

the hurrying light.

    The koels were weary of their

songs.

    I was walking by the road, I do not

know why.

    The hut by the side of the water is

shaded by an overhanging tree.

    Some on was busy with her work,

and her bangles made music in the

corner.

    I stood before this hut, I know not

why.

    The narrow winding road crosses

many a mustard field, and many a

mango forest.

    It passes by the temple of the

village and the market at the river

landing-place.

    I stopped by this hut, I do not know

why.

    Years ago it was a day of breezy

March when the murmur of the spring

was languorous, and mango blossoms

were dropping on the dust.

    The rippling water leapt and licked

the brass vessel that stood on the

landing-step.

    I think of that day of breezy March,

I do not know why.

    Shadows are deepening and cattle

returning to their folds.

    The light is grey upon the lonely

meadows, and the villagers are waiting

for the ferry at the bank.

    I slowly return upon my steps, I

do not know why.

Poem 128: The Gardener XLII: O Mad, Superbly Drunk

O mad, superbly drunk;

    If you kick open your doors and

play the fool in public;

    If you empty your bag in a night,

and snap your fingers at prudence;

    If you walk in curious paths and

play with useless things;

storm you snap the rudder in two,

    Then I will follow you, comrade,

    I have wasted my days and nights

in the company of steady wise neighbours.

    Much knowing has turned my hair

grey, and much watching has made

my sight dim.

    For years I have gathered and

heaped up scraps and fragments of

things:

    Crush them and dance upon them,

and scatter them all to the winds.

    For I know 'tis the height of wisdom

to be drunken and go the dogs.

    Let all crooked scruples vanish,

let me hopelessly lose my way.

    Let a gust of wild giddiness come

and sweep me away from my anchors.

    The world is peopled with worthies,

and workers, useful and clever.

    There are men who are easily first,

and men who come decently after.

    Let them be happy and prosper,

and let me be foolishly futile.

    For I know 'tis the end of all works

to be drunken and go to the dogs.

    I swear to surrender this moment

all claims to the ranks of the decent.

    I let go my pride of learning and

judgment of right and of wrong.

    I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering

the last drop of tears.

    With the foam of the berry-red

wine I will bathe and brighten my

laughter.

    The badge of the civil and staid

I'll tear into shreds for the nonce.

    I'll take the holy vow to be worthless,

Poem 137: The Gardener XXCIII: She Dwelt on the Hillside

She dwelt on the hillside by edge

of a maize-field, near the spring that

flows in laughing rills through the

solemn shadows of ancient trees. The

women came there to fill their jars,

and travellers would sit there to rest

and talk. She worked and dreamed

daily to the tune of the bubbling

stream.

    One evening the stranger came down

from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks

were tangled like drowsy snakes. We

asked in wonder, "Who are you?"

He answered not but sat by the

garrulous stream and silently gazed at

the hut where she dwelt. Our hearts

quaked in fear and we came back home

when it was night.

    Next morning when the women

came to fetch water at the spring by

the deodar trees, they found the doors

open in her hut, but her voice was gone

and where was her smiling face?

The empty jar lay on the floor and her

lamp had burnt itself out in the

corner. No one knew where she had

fled to before it was morning--and the

stranger had gone.

    In the month of May the sun grew

strong and the snow melted, and we

sat by the spring and wept. We

wondered in our mind, "Is there a

spring in the land where she has gone

and where she can fill her vessel in

these hot thirsty days?" And we

asked each other in dismay, "Is there

a land beyond these hills where we

live?"

    It was a summer night; the breeze

blew from the south; and I sat in her

deserted room where the lamp stood

still unlit. When suddenly from

before my eyes the hills vanished like

curtains drawn aside. "Ah, it is

she who comes. How are you, my

child? Are you happy? But where

can you shelter under this open sky?

And, alas! our spring is not here to

allay your thirst."

    "Here is the same sky," she said,

"only free from the fencing hills,--

this is the same stream grown into a

river,--the same earth widened into

a plain." "Everything is here," I

sighed, "only we are not." She

smiled sadly and said, "You are in

my heart." I woke up and heard the

babbling of the stream and the rustling

of the deodars at night.

Poem 148: The Golden Boat

Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.

I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.

The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,

The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.

As we cut the paddy it started to rain.


One small paddy-field, no one but me -

Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.

Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink

On a village painted on deep morning grey.

On this side a paddy-field, no one but me.


Who is this, steering close to the shore

Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.

The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,

Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.

I watch and feel I have seen her face before.


Oh to what foreign land do you sail?

Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.

Go where you want to, give where you care to,

But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -

Take away my golden paddy when you sail.


Take it, take as much as you can load.

Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.

My intense labour here by the river -

I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;

Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard.


No room, no room, the boat is too small.

Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.

Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,

On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -

What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

Poem 149: The Hero

Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a

strange and dangerous country.

    You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a

red horse.

    It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of Joradighi

lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.

    You are frightened and thinking-"I know not where we have come

to."

    I say to you, "Mother, do not be afraid."

    The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs

a narrow broken path.

    There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have

gone to their village stalls.

    It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell

where we are going.

    Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, "What light is

that near the bank?"

    Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come

running towards us.

    You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the

gods in prayer.

    The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny

bush.

    I shout to you, "Don't be afraid, mother. I am here."

    With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their

heads, they come nearer and nearer.

    I shout, "Have a care, you villains! One step more and you are

dead men."

    They give another terrible yell and rush forward.

    You clutch my hand and say, "Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep

away from them."

    I say, "Mother, just you watch me."

    Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and

buckler clash against each other.

    The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you

a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.

    Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.

    I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your

boy must be dead by this time.

    But I come to you all stained with blood, and say,"Mother, the

fight is over now."

    You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you

say to yourself,

    "I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort

me."

    A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why

couldn't such a thing come true by chance?

    It would be like a story in a book.

    My brother would say, "Is it possible? I always thought he was

so delicate!"

    Our village people would all say in amazement, "Was it not

lucky that the boy was with his mother?"

    The daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness, and the

widowed land, whose harvest had been reaped, lay silent.

    Suddenly a boy's shrill voice rose into the sky. He traversed

the dark unseen, leaving the track of his song across the hush of

the evening.

    His village home lay there at the end of the waste land,

beyond the sugar-cane field, hidden among the shadows of the banana

and the slender areca palm, the coconut and the dark green jack-

fruit trees.

    I stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight,

and saw spread before me the darkened earth surrounding with her

arms countless homes furnished with cradles and beds, mother's

hearts and evening lamps, and young lives glad with a gladness that

knows nothing of its value for the world.

Poem 151: The Journey

The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs;

and the flowers were all merry by the roadside;

and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds

while we busily went on our way and paid no heed.


We sang no glad songs nor played;

we went not to the village for barter;

we spoke not a word nor smiled;

we lingered not on the way.

We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.


The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade.

Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon.

The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree,

and I laid myself down by the water

and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.


My companions laughed at me in scorn;

they held their heads high and hurried on;

they never looked back nor rested;

they vanished in the distant blue haze.


They crossed many meadows and hills,

and passed through strange, far-away countries.

All honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path!

Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise,

but found no response in me.


I gave myself up for lost

in the depth of a glad humiliation

---in the shadow of a dim delight.


The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom

slowly spread over my heart.

I forgot for what I had traveled,

and I surrendered my mind without struggle

to the maze of shadows and songs.


At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes,

I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile.

How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome,

and the struggle to reach thee was hard!

Poem 152: The Judge

Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings.

    I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my

little child.

    How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh

his merits against his faults?

    When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my

being.

    When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.

    I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may

chastise who loves.

Poem 153: The Kiss

Lips' language to lips' ears.

Two drinking each other's heart, it seems.

Two roving loves who have left home,

pilgrims to the confluence of lips.

Two waves rise by the law of love

to break and die on two sets of lips.

Two wild desires craving each other

meet at last at the body's limits.

Love's writing a song in dainty letters,

layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.

Plucking flowers from two sets of lips

perhaps to thread them into a chain later.

This sweet union of lips

is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.

Poem 154: The Land of the Exile

Mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; I do not know what

the time is.

    There is no fun in my play, so I have come to you. It is

Saturday, our holiday.

    Leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell

me where the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is.

    The shadow of the  rains has covered the day from end to end.

    The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.

    When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid

in my heart and cling to you.

    When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves,

and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to

sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about

the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale.

    Where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of

what hills, in the kingdom of what king?

    There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath

across it by which the villagers reach their village in the

evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can

bring her load to the market. With patches of yellow grass in the

sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their

nest, lies the desert of Tepantar.

    I can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son

of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in

search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace

across that unknown water.

    When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and

lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his

unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and

wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of Tepantar in

the fairy tale?

    See, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and

thee are no travellers yonder on the village road.

    The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men

have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their

huts, watching the scowling clouds.

    Mother, I have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me

to do my lessons now.

    When I grow up and am bid like my father, I shall learn all

that must be learnt.

    But just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of

Tepantar in the fairy tale is.

Poem 155: The Last Bargain

"Come and hire me," I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road.

    Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot.

    He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power."

    But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.


    In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors.

    I wandered along the crooked lane.

    An old man came out with his bag of gold.

    He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."

    He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.


  It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.

  The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."

  Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.


  The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.

  A child sat playing with shells.

  He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."

  From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the

    Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence.

    O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.

    Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes

as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is

has run away from his mother to tease her.

    Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.

    O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry

is closed.

    The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the

water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home

early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.

    The evening lamps must be made ready.

    The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is

slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo

pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn

cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew

It's ancient tale of being apart or together.

As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,

Clad in the light of a pole-star, piercing the darkness of time.

You become an image of what is remembered forever.


You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.

At the heart of time, love of one for another.

Shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting,

the distressful tears of farewell,

Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

An' 'e sweats like a Jolly -- 'Er Majesty's Jolly -- soldier an' sailor too!

For there isn't a job on the top o' the earth the beggar don't know, nor do --

You can leave 'im at night on a bald man's 'ead, to paddle 'is own canoe --

'E's a sort of a bloomin' cosmopolouse -- soldier an' sailor too.


We've fought 'em in trooper, we've fought 'em in dock,

 and drunk with 'em in betweens,

When they called us the seasick scull'ry-maids,

 an' we called 'em the Ass Marines;

But, when we was down for a double fatigue, from Woolwich to Bernardmyo,

We sent for the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!

They think for 'emselves, an' they steal for 'emselves,

 and they never ask what's to do,

But they're camped an' fed an' they're up an' fed before our bugle's blew.

Ho! they ain't no limpin' procrastitutes -- soldier an' sailor too.


You may say we are fond of an 'arness-cut, or 'ootin' in barrick-yards,

Or startin' a Board School mutiny along o' the Onion Guards;

But once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view,

The same as the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!

They come of our lot, they was brothers to us;

 they was beggars we'd met an' knew;

Yes, barrin' an inch in the chest an' the arm, they was doubles o' me an' you;

For they weren't no special chrysanthemums -- soldier an' sailor too!


To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about,

Is nothing so bad when you've cover to 'and, an' leave an' likin' to shout;

But to stand an' be still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill

 is a damn tough bullet to chew,

An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --

 soldier an' sailor too!

Their work was done when it 'adn't begun; they was younger nor me an' you;

Their choice it was plain between drownin' in 'eaps

 an' bein' mopped by the screw,

So they stood an' was still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill, soldier an' sailor too!


We're most of us liars, we're 'arf of us thieves,

 an' the rest are as rank as can be,

But once in a while we can finish in style

 (which I 'ope it won't 'appen to me).

But it makes you think better o' you an' your friends,

 an' the work you may 'ave to do,

When you think o' the sinkin' ~Victorier~'s Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!

Now there isn't no room for to say ye don't know --

 they 'ave proved it plain and true --

That whether it's Widow, or whether it's ship, Victorier's work is to do,

An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --

Poem 3: A Ballad of Burial


If down here I chance to die,

 Solemnly I beg you take

All that is left of "I"

 To the Hills for old sake's sake,

Pack me very thoroughly

 In the ice that used to slake

Pegs I drank when I was dry --

 This observe for old sake's sake.


To the railway station hie,

 There a single ticket take

For Umballa -- goods-train -- I

 Shall not mind delay or shake.

I shall rest contentedly

 Spite of clamor coolies make;

Thus in state and dignity

 Send me up for old sake's sake.


Next the sleepy Babu wake,

 Book a Kalka van "for four."

Few, I think, will care to make

 Journeys with me any more

As they used to do of yore.

 I shall need a "special" break --

Thing I never took before --

 Get me one for old sake's sake.


After that -- arrangements make.

 No hotel will take me in,

And a bullock's back would break

 'Neath the teak and leaden skin

Tonga ropes are frail and thin,

 Or, did I a back-seat take,

In a tonga I might spin, --

 Do your best for old sake's sake.


After that -- your work is done.

 Recollect a Padre must

Mourn the dear departed one --

 Throw the ashes and the dust.

Don't go down at once. I trust

 You will find excuse to "snake

Three days' casual on the bust."

 Get your fun for old sake's sake.


I could never stand the Plains.

 Think of blazing June and May

Think of those September rains

 Yearly till the Judgment Day!

I should never rest in peace,

 I should sweat and lie awake.

Rail me then, on my decease,

 To the Hills for old sake's sake.

Poem 4: A Ballade of Jakko Hill


One moment bid the horses wait,

 Since tiffin is not laid till three,

Below the upward path and straight

 You climbed a year ago with me.

Love came upon us suddenly

 And loosed -- an idle hour to kill --

A headless, armless armory

 That smote us both on Jakko Hill.


Ah Heaven! we would wait and wait

 Through Time and to Eternity!

Ah Heaven! we could conquer Fate

 With more than Godlike constancy

I cut the date upon a tree --

 Here stand the clumsy figures still:

"10-7-85, A.D."

 Damp with the mist of Jakko Hill.


What came of high resolve and great,

 And until Death fidelity!

Whose horse is waiting at your gate?

 Whose 'rickshaw-wheels ride over me?

No Saint's, I swear; and -- let me see

 To-night what names your programme fill --

We drift asunder merrily,

 As drifts the mist on Jakko Hill.


               L'ENVOI.

Princess, behold our ancient state

 Has clean departed; and we see

'Twas Idleness we took for Fate

 That bound light bonds on you and me.

Amen! Here ends the comedy

 Where it began in all good will;

Since Love and Leave together flee

 As driven mist on Jakko Hill!

Poem 6: A Boy Scouts' Patrol Song


These are our regulations --

 There's just one law for the Scout

And the first and the last, and the present and the past,

 And the future and the perfect is "Look out!"

 I, thou and he, look out!

 We, ye and they, look out!

 Though you didn't or you wouldn't

 Or you hadn't or you couldn't;

 You jolly well must look out!


Look out, when you start for the day

 That your kit is packed to your mind;

There is no use going away            

 With half of it left behind.

Look out that your laces are tight,

 And your boots are easy and stout,

Or you'll end with a blister at night.

(Chorus) All Patrols look out!


Look out for the birds of the air,

 Look out for the beasts of the field --

They'll tell you how and where

 The other side's concealed.

When the blackbird bolts from the copse,

 Or the cattle are staring about,

The wise commander stops

 And (chorus) All Patrols look out!


Look out when your front is clear,

 And you feel you are bound to win.

Look out for your flank and your rear --

 That's where surprises begin.

For the rustle that isn't a rat,

 For the splash that isn't a trout,

For the boulder that may be a hat

(Chorus) All Patrols look out!


For the innocent knee-high grass,

 For the ditch that never tells,

Look out!  Look out ere you pass --

 And look out for everything else!

A sign mis-read as you run

 May turn retreat to a rout --

For all things under the sun

(Chorus) All Patrols look out!


Look out when your temper goes

 At the end of a losing game;

When your boots are too tight for your toes;

 And you answer and argue and blame.

It's the hardest part of the Low,

 But it has to be learnt by the Scout --

For whining and shirking and "jaw"

(Chorus) All Patrols look out!

Poem 7: A British-Roman Song


My father's father saw it not,

And I, belike, shall never come

To look on that so-holy spot --

That very Rome --


Crowned by all Time, all Art, all Might,

The equal work of Gods and Man,

City beneath whose oldest height --

The Race began!


Soon to send forth again a brood,

Unshakable, we pray, that clings

To Rome's thrice-hammered hardihood --

In arduous things.


Strong heart with triple armour bound,

Beat strongly, for thy life-blood runs,

Age after Age, the Empire round --

In us thy Sons


Who, distant from the Seven Hills,

Loving and serving much, require

Thee -- thee to guard 'gainst home-born ills

The Imperial Fire!

To kneel to Judah's King,

He binds His frost upon the land

To ripen it for Spring --

To ripen it for Spring, good sirs,

According to His Word.

Which well must be as ye can see --

And who shall judge the Lord?


When we poor fenmen skate the ice

Or shiver on the wold,

We hear the cry of a single tree

That breaks her heart in the cold --

That breaks her heart in the cold, good sirs,

And rendeth by the board.

Which well must be as ye can see --

And who shall judge the Lord?


Her wood is crazed and little worth

Excepting as to burn,

That we may warm and make our mirth

Until the Spring return --

Until the Spring return, good sirs,

When Christians walk abroad;

When well must be as ye can see --

And who shall judge the Lord?


God bless the master of this house,

And all who sleep therein!

And guard the fens from pirate folk,

And keep us all from sin,

To walk in honesty, good sirs,

Of thought and deed ad word!

Which shall befriend our latter end....

Poem 9: A Charm


Take of English earth as much

As either hand may rightly clutch.

In the taking of it breathe

Prayer for all who lie beneath.

Not the great nor well-bespoke,

But the mere uncounted folk

Of whose life and death is none

Report or lamentation.

Lay that earth upon thy heart,

And thy sickness shall depart!


It shall sweeten and make whole

Fevered breath and festered soul.

It shall mightily restrain

Over-busied hand and brain.

It shall ease thy mortal strife

'Gainst the immortal woe of life,

Till thyself, restored, shall prove

By what grace the Heavens do move.


Take of English flowers these --

Spring's full-vaced primroses,

Summer's wild wide-hearted rose,

Autumn's wall-flower of the close,

And, thy darkness to illume,

Winter's bee-thronged ivy-bloom.

Seek and serve them where they bide

From Candlemas to Christmas-tide,

For these simples, used aright,

Can restore a failing sight.


These shall cleanse and purify

Webbed and inward-turning eye;

These shall show thee treasure hid,

Thy familiar fields amid;

And reveal (which is thy need)

Every man a King indeed!

Poem 10: A Child's Garden


Now there is nothing wrong with me

Except -- I think it's called T.B.

And that is why I have to lay

Out in the garden all the day.


Our garden is not very wide

And cars go by on either side,

And make an angry-hooty noise

That rather startles little boys.


But worst of all is when they take

Me out in cars that growl and shake,

With charabancs so dreadful-near

I have to shut my eyes for fear.


But when I'm on my back again,

I watch the Croydon aeroplane

That flies across to France, and sings

Like hitting thick piano-strings.


When I am strong enough to do

The things I'm truly wishful to,

I'll never use a car or train

But always have an aeroplane;


And just go zooming round and round,

And frighten Nursey with the sound,

And see the angel-side of clouds,

And spit on all those motor-crowds!

Poem 11: A Code of Morals


Now Jones had left his new-wed bride to keep his house in order,

And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border,

To sit on a rock with a heliograph; but ere he left he taught

His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught.


And Love had made him very sage, as Nature made her fair;

So Cupid and Apollo linked , per heliograph, the pair.

At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise --

At e'en, the dying sunset bore her husband's homilies.


He warned her 'gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold,

As much as 'gainst the blandishments paternal of the old;

But kept his gravest warnings for (hereby the ditty hangs)

That snowy-haired Lothario, Lieutenant-General Bangs.


'Twas General Bangs, with Aide and Staff, who tittupped on the way,

When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play.

They thought of Border risings, and of stations sacked and burnt --

So stopped to take the message down -- and this is whay they learnt --


"Dash dot dot, dot, dot dash, dot dash dot" twice. The General swore.

"Was ever General Officer addressed as 'dear' before?

"'My Love,' i' faith! 'My Duck,' Gadzooks! 'My darling popsy-wop!'

"Spirit of great Lord Wolseley, who is on that mountaintop?"


The artless Aide-de-camp was mute; the gilded Staff were still,

As, dumb with pent-up mirth, they booked that message from the hill;

For clear as summer lightning-flare, the husband's warning ran: --

"Don't dance or ride with General Bangs -- a most immoral man."


[At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise --

But, howsoever Love be blind, the world at large hath eyes.]

With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife

Some interesting details of the General's private life.


The artless Aide-de-camp was mute, the shining Staff were still,

And red and ever redder grew the General's shaven gill.

And this is what he said at last (his feelings matter not): --

"I think we've tapped a private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!"


All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know

By word or act official who read off that helio.

But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Mooltan

They know the worthy General as "that most immoral man."

Poem 12: A Counting-Out Song


What is the song the children sing,

When doorway lilacs bloom in Spring,

And the Schools are loosed, and the games are played

That were deadly earnest when Earth was made?

Hear them chattering, shrill and hard,

After dinner-time, out in the yard,

As the sides are chosen and all submit

To the chance of the lot that shall make them "It."

(Singing) "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Catch a nigger by the toe!

(If he hollers let him go!)

Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!

You-are-It!"


Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, and Mo

Were the First Big Four of the Long Ago,

When the Pole of the Earth sloped thirty degrees,

And Central Europe began to freeze,

And they needed Ambassadors staunch and stark

To steady the Tribes in the gathering dark:

But the frost was fierce and flesh was frail,

So they launched a Magic that could not fail.

(Singing) "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Hear the wolves across the snow!

Some one has to kill 'em--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make--you--It!"


Slowly the Glacial Epoch passed,

Central Europe thawed out at last;

And, under the slush of the melting snows

The first dim shapes of the Nations rose.

Rome, Britannia, Belgium, Gaul--

Flood and avalanche fathered them all;

And the First Big Four, as they watched the mess,

Pitied Man in his helplessness.

(Singing) "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Trouble starts When Nations grow,

Some one has to stop it--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Make-you-It!"


Thus it happened, but none can tell

What was the Power behind the spell--

Fear, or Duty, or Pride, or Faith--

That sent men shuddering out to death--

To cold and watching, and, worse than these,

Work, more work, when they looked for ease--

To the days discomfort, the nights despair,

In the hope of a prize that they never could share,

(Singing) "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Man is born to Toil and Woe.

One will cure another--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make--you--It!"


Once and again, as the Ice went North

The grass crept up to the Firth of Forth.

Once and again, as the Ice came South

The glaciers ground over Lossiemouth.

But, grass or glacier, cold or hot,

The men went out who would rather not,

And fought with the Tiger, the Pig and the Ape,

To hammer the world into decent shape.

(Singing) "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

What's the use of doing so?

Ask the Gods, for we don't know;

But Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make-us-It!"


Nothing is left of that terrible rune

But a tag of gibberish tacked to a tune

That ends the waiting and settles the claims

Of children arguing over their games;

For never yet has a boy been found

To shirk his turn when the turn came round;

Nor even a girl has been known to say

"If you laugh at me I shan't play."

For--  "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo,

(Don't you let the grown-ups know!)

You may hate it ever so,

But if you're chose you're bound to go,

When Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make-you-It!"

This is the State above the Law.

 The State exists for the State alone."

 And an answering lump by the collar-bone.]

  Some die silent, by shell and shot.

Some die desperate, caught on the wire -

 Some die suddenly. This will not.


"Regis suprema voluntas Lex"

[It will follow the regular course of--throats.]

Some die pinned by the broken decks,

 Some die sobbing between the boats.


Some die eloquent, pressed to death

 By the sliding trench as their friends can hear

Some die wholly in half a breath.

 Some--give trouble for half a year.


"There is neither Evil nor Good in life

 Except as the needs of the State ordain."

[Since it is rather too late for the knife,

All we can do is to mask the pain.]


Some die saintly in faith and hope--

 One died thus in a prison-yard--

Some die broken by rape or the rope;

 Some die easily. This dies hard.


"I will dash to pieces who bar my way.

 Woe to the traitor! Woe to the weak! "

[Let him write what he wishes to say.

It tires him out if he tries to speak.

Some die quietly. Some abound

 In loud self-pity. Others spread

Bad morale through the cots around  

 This is a type that is better dead.


"The war was forced on me by my foes.

  All that I sought was the right to live."

[Don't be afraid of a triple dose;

While the effects of the drug endure. . . .

Poem 16: A Departure


Since first the White Horse Banner blew free,

 By Hengist's horde unfurled,

Nothing has changed on land or sea

 Of the things that steer the world.

(As it was when the long-ships scudded through the gale

 So it is where the Liners go.)

Time and Tide, they are both in a tale--

 "Woe to the weaker -- woe! "


No charm can bridle the hard-mouthed wind

 Or smooth the fretting swell.

No gift can alter the grey Sea's mind,

 But she serves the strong man well.

(As it is when her uttermost deeps are stirred

 So it is where the quicksands show,)

All the waters have but one word--

 "Woe to the weaker -- woe! "


The feast is ended, the tales are told,

 The dawn is overdue,

And we meet on the quay in the whistling cold

 Where the galley waits her crew.

Out with the torches, they have flared too long,

 And bid the harpers go.

Wind and warfare have but one song--

 "Woe to the weaker -- woe!"


Hail to the great oars gathering way,

 As the beach begins to slide!

Hail to the war-shields' click and play

 As they lift along our side!

Hail to the first wave over the bow--

 Slow for the sea-stroke! Slow!--

All the benches are grunting now:--

We are very slightly changed

From the semi-apes who ranged

"Dowb," the first of all his race,

Met the Mammoth face to face

 On the lake or in the cave:

Stole the steadiest canoe,

Ate the quarry others slew,

 Died -- and took the finest grave.


When they scratched the reindeer-bone,

Some one made the sketch his own,

 Filched it from the artist -- then,

Even in those early days,

Won a simple Viceroy's praise

 Through the toil of other men.

Ere they hewed the Sphinx's visage

Favouritism governed kissage,

 Even as it does in this age.


Who shall doubt "the secret hid

Under Cheops' pyramid"

Was that the contractor did

 Cheops out of several millions?

Or that Joseph's sudden rise

To comptroller of Supplies

Was a fraud of monstrous size

 On King Pharaoh's swart Civilians?


Thus, the artless songs I sing

Do not deal with anything

 New or never said before.

As it was in the beginning

Is to-day official sinning,

 And shall be for evermore!

Poem 18: A Legend of Truth


Once on a time, the ancient legends tell,

Truth, rising from the bottom of her well,

Looked on the world, but, hearing how it lied,

Returned to her seclusion horrified.

There she abode, so conscious of her worth,

Not even Pilate's Question called her forth,

Nor Galileo, kneeling to deny

The Laws that hold our Planet 'neath the sky.

Meantime, her kindlier sister, whom men call

Fiction, did all her work and more than all,

With so much zeal, devotion, tact, and care,

That no one noticed Truth was otherwhere.


Then came a War when, bombed and gassed and mined,

Truth rose once more, perforce, to meet mankind,

And through the dust and glare and wreck of things,

Beheld a phantom on unbalanced wings,

Reeling and groping, dazed, dishevelled, dumb,

But semaphoring direr deeds to come.


Truth hailed and bade her stand; the quavering shade

Clung to her knees and babbled, "Sister, aid!

I am--I was--thy Deputy, and men

Besought me for my useful tongue or pen

To gloss their gentle deeds, and I complied,

And they, and thy demands, were satisfied.

But this--" she pointed o'er the blistered plain,

Where men as Gods and devils wrought amain--

"This is beyond me! Take thy work again."


Tablets and pen transferred, she fled afar,

And Truth assumed the record of the War...

She saw, she heard, she read, she tried to tell

Facts beyond precedent and parallel--

Unfit to hint or breathe, much less to write,

But happening every minute, day and night.

She called for proof. It came. The dossiers grew.

She marked them, first, "Return. This can't be true."

Then, underneath the cold official word:

"This is not really half of what occurred."


She faced herself at last, the story runs,

And telegraphed her sister: "Come at once.

Facts out of hand. Unable overtake

Without your aid. Come back for Truth's own sake!

Co-equal rank and powers if you agree.

They need us both, but you far more than me!"

Of morning, body and soul, till the great Age

 Fulfills in one great chord:--Elizabeth!

Poem 22: A Pict Song


Rome never looks where she treads.

 Always her heavy hooves fall

On our stomachs, our hearts or our heads;

 And Rome never heeds when we bawl.

Her sentries pass on--that is all,

  And we gather behind them in hordes,

And plot to reconquer the Wall,

  With only our tongues for our swords.


We are the Little Folk--we!

  Too little to love or to hate.

Leave us alone and you'll see

  How we can drag down the State!

We are the worm in the wood!

 We are the rot at the root!

We are the taint in the blood!

  We are the thorn in the foot!


Mistletoe  killing  an  oak--

 Rats gnawing cables in two--

Moths making holes in a cloak--

 How they must love what they do!

Yes--and we Little Folk too,

 We are busy as they--

Working our works out of view--

 Watch, and you'll see it some day!


No indeed! We are not strong,

 But we know Peoples that are.

Yes, and we'll guide them along

 To smash and destroy you in War!

We shall be slaves just the same?

 Yes, we have always been slaves,

But you--you will die of the shame,

 And then we shall dance on your graves!


We are the Little Folk, we, etc.

Poem 23: A Pilgrim's Way


I do not look for holy saints to guide me on my way,

Or male and female devilkins to lead my feet astray.

If these are added, I rejoice---if not, I shall not mind,

So long as I have leave and choice to meet my fellow-kind.

For as we come and as we go (and deadly-soon go we!)

The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!


Thus I will honour pious men whose virtue shines so bright

(Though none are more amazed than I when I by chance do right),

And I will pity foolish men for woe their sins have bred

(Though ninety-nine per cent. of mine I brought on my own head).

And, Amorite or Eremite, or General Averagee,

The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!


And when they bore me overmuch, I will not shake mine ears,

Recalling many thousand such whom I have bored to tears.

And when they labour to impress, I will not doubt nor scoff;

Since I myself have done no less and---sometimes pulled it off.

Yea, as we are and we are not, and we pretend to be,

The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!


And when they work me random wrong, as oftentimes hath been,

I will not cherish hate too long (my hands are none too clean).

And when they do me random good I will not feign surprise.

No more than those whom I have cheered with wayside charities.

But, as we give and as we take---whate'er our takings be---

The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!


But when I meet with frantic folk who sinfully declare

There is no pardon for their sin, the same I will not spare

Till I have proved that Heaven and Hell which in our hearts we have

Show nothing irredeemable on either side of the grave.

For as we live and as we die---if utter Death there be---

The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!


Deliver me from every pride---the Middle, High, and Low---

That bars me from a brother's side, whatever pride he show.

And purge me from all heresies of thought and speech and pen

That bid me judge him otherwise than I am judged. Amen!

That I may sing of Crowd or King or road-borne company,

That I may labour in my day, vocation and degree,

To prove the same in deed and name, and hold unshakenly

(Where'er I go, whate'er I know, whoe'er my neighbor be)

This single faith in Life and Death and to Eternity:

``The people, Lord, Thy people, are good enough for me!''

Poem 24: A Preface


To all to whom this little book may come--

  Health for yourselves and those you hold most dear!

Content abroad, and happiness at home,

  And--one grand Secret in your private ear: --

Nations have passed away and left no traces,

And History gives the naked cause of it--

  One single, simple reason in all cases;

They fell because their peoples were not fit.


Now, though your Body be mis-shapen, blind,

 Lame, feverish, lacking substance, power or skill,

Certain it is that men can school the Mind

 To school the sickliest Body, to her will--

 As many have done, whose glory blazes still

Like mighty flames in meanest lanterns lit:

 Wherefore, we pray the crippled, weak and ill--

Be fit--be fit! In mind at first be fit!


And, though your Spirit seem uncouth or small,

 Stubborn as clay or shifting as the sand,

Strengthen the Body, and the Body shall

 Strengthen the Spirit till she take command;

 As a bold rider brings his horse in hand

At the tall fence, with voice and heel and bit,

 And leaps while all the field are at a stand.

Be fit--be fit! In body next be fit!


 Nothing on earth--no Arts, no Gifts, no Graces--

      No Fame, no Wealth--outweighs the wont of it.

    This is the Law which every law embraces--

      Be fit--be fit! In mind and body be fit!


The even heart that seldom slurs its beat--

 The cool head weighing what that heart desires--

The measuring eye that guides the hands and feet--

 The Soul unbroken when the Body tires--

 These are the things our weary world requires

Far more than superfluities of wit;

 Wherefore we pray you, sons of generous sires,

Be fit--be fit! For Honour's sake be fit.


 There is one lesson at all Times and Places--

      One changeless Truth on all things changing writ,

    For boys and girls, men, women, nations, races--

      Be fit -- be fit! And once again, be fit!

Poem 25: A Recantation


What boots it on the Gods to call?

 Since, answered or unheard,

We perish with the Gods and all

 Things made--except the Word.


Ere certain Fate had touched a heart

 By fifty years made cold,

I judged thee, Lyde, and thy art

 O'erblown and over-bold.


But he--but he, of whom bereft

 I suffer vacant days--

He on his shield not meanly left

 He cherished all thy lays.


Witness the magic coffer stocked

 With convoluted runes

Wherein thy very voice was locked

  And linked to circling tunes.


Witness thy portrait, smoke-defiled,

 That decked his shelter-place.

Life seemed more present, wrote the child,

 Beneath thy well-known face.


And when the grudging days restored

 Him for a breath to home,

He, with fresh crowds of youth, adored

 Thee making mirth in Rome.


Therefore, I humble, join the hosts,

 Loyal and loud, who bow

To thee as Queen of Song--and ghosts,

 For I remember how


Never more rampant rose the Hall

 At thy audacious line

Than when the news came in from Gaul

 Thy son had--followed mine.


But thou didst hide it in thy breast

 And, capering, took the brunt

Of blaze and blare, and launched the jest

 That swept next week the front.


Singer to children!   Ours possessed

 Sleep before noon--but thee,

Wakeful each midnight for the rest,

 No holocaust shall free!


Yet they who use the Word assigned,

 To hearten and make whole,

Not less than Gods have served mankind,

 Though vultures rend their soul.

Poem 26: A Rector's Memory


The, Gods that are wiser than Learning

 But kinder than Life have made sure

No mortal may boast in the morning

 That even will find him secure.

With naught for fresh faith or new trial,

 With little unsoiled or unsold,

Can the shadow go back on the dial,

 Or a new world be given for the old?

     But he knows not that time shall awaken,

       As he knows not what tide shall lay bare,

     The heart of a man to be taken --

      Taken and changed unaware.


He shall see as he tenders his vows

  The far, guarded City arise --

The power of the North 'twixt Her brows --

  The steel of the North in Her eyes;

The sheer hosts of Heaven above --

  The grey warlock Ocean beside;

And shall feel the full centuries move

  To Her purpose and pride.


Though a stranger shall he understand,

 As though it were old in his blood,

The lives that caught fire 'neath Her hand --

 The fires that were tamed to Her mood.

And the roar of the wind shall refashion,

 And the wind-driven torches recall,

The passing of Time and the passion

 Of Youth over all!

     And, by virtue of magic unspoken

       (What need She should utter Her power?)

     The frost at his heart shall be broken

       And his spirit be changed in that hour --

    Changed and renewed in that hour!

Poem 27: A Ripple Song


Once red ripple came to land

    In the golden sunset burning--

  Lapped against a maiden's hand,

    By the ford returning.


  Dainty foot and gentle breast--

  Here, across, be glad and rest.

  "Maiden, wait," the ripple saith;

  "Wait awhile, for I am Death!"


  "Where my lover calls I go--

    Shame it were to treat him coldly--

  'Twas a fish that circled so,

    Turning over boldly."


  Dainty foot and tender heart,

  Wait the loaded ferry-raft.

  "Wait, ah, wait!" the ripple saith;

  "Maiden, wait, for I am Death!"


  "When my lover calls I haste--

    Dame Disdain was never wedded!"

  Ripple-ripple round her waist,

    Clear the current eddied.


  Foolish heart and faithful hand,

  Little feet that touched no land.

  Far away the ripple sped,

  Ripple-ripple running red!

Poem 28: A School Song


"Let us now praise famous men"--

    Men of little showing--

For their work continueth,

And their work continueth,  

Broad and deep continues,

   Greater then their knowing!


Western wind and open surge

   Took us from our mothers--

Flung us on a naked shore

(Twelve bleak houses by the shore.

Seven summers by the shore! )

   'Mid two hundred brothers.


There we met with famous men

   Set in office o'er us;

And they beat on us with rods--

Faithfully with many rods--

Daily beat us on with rods,

    For the love they bore us!


Out of Egypt unto Troy--

   Over Himalaya--

Far and sure our bands have gone--

Hy-Brazil or Babylon,

Islands of the Southern Run,

  And Cities of Cathaia!


And we all praise famous men--

   Ancients of the College;

For they taught us common sense--

Tried to teach us common sense--

Truth and God's Own Common Sense,

   Which is more than knowledge!


Each degree of Latitude

   Strung about Creation

Seeth one or more of us

(Of one muster each of us),

Diligent in that he does,

   Keen in his vocation.


This we learned from famous men,

    Knowing not its uses,

When they showed, in daily work--

Man must finish off his work--

Right or wrong, his daily work--

   And without excuses.


Servant of the Staff and chain,

 Mine and fuse and grapnel--

Some, before the face of Kings,

Stand before the face of Kings;

Bearing gifts to divers Kings--

 Gifts of case and shrapnel.


This we learned from famous men

 Teaching in our borders,

Who declared it was best,

Safest,  easiest,  and best--

Expeditious, wise, and best--

 To obey your orders.


Some beneath the further stars

 Bear the greater burden:

Set to serve the lands they rule,

(Save he serve no man may rule),

Serve and love the lands they rule;

 Seeking praise nor guerdon.


This we learned from famous men,

 Knowing not we learned it.

Only, as the years went by--

Lonely, as the years went by--

Far from help as years went by,

 Plainer we discerned it.


Wherefore praise we famous men

 From whose bays we borrow--

They that put aside To-day--

All the joys of their To-day--

And with toil of their To-day

 Bought for us To-morrow!


Bless and praise we famous men--

 Men of little showing--

For their work continueth,

And their work continueth,

Broad and deep continueth,

  Great beyond their knowing!

Poem 29: A Servant When He Reigneth


Three things make earth unquiet

And four she cannot brook

The godly Agur counted them

And put them in a book --

Those Four Tremendous Curses

With which mankind is cursed;

But a Servant when He Reigneth

Old Agur entered first.

An Handmaid that is Mistress

We need not call upon.

A Fool when he is full of Meat

Will fall asleep anon.

An Odious Woman Married

May bear a babe and mend;

But a Servant when He Reigneth

Is Confusion to the end.


His feet are swift to tumult,

His hands are slow to toil,

His ears are deaf to reason,

His lips are loud in broil.

He knows no use for power

Except to show his might.

He gives no heed to judgment

Unless it prove him right.


Because he served a master

Before his Kingship came,

And hid in all disaster

Behind his master's name,

So, when his Folly opens

The unnecessary hells,

A Servant when He Reigneth

Throws the blame on some one else.


His vows are lightly spoken,

His faith is hard to bind,

His trust is easy broken,

He fears his fellow-kind.

The nearest mob will move him

To break the pledge he gave --

Oh, a Servant when he Reigneth

Is more than ever slave!

Poem 30: A Smuggler's Song


If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse's feet,

Don't go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street.

Them that ask no questions isn't told a lie.

Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

Five and twenty ponies,

Trotting through the dark --

Brandy for the Parson,

'Baccy for the Clerk;

Laces for a lady, letters for a spy,

And watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!


Running round the woodlump if you chance to find

Little barrels, roped and tarred, all full of brandy-wine,

Don't you shout to come and look, nor use 'em for your play.

Put the brishwood back again -- and they'll be gone next day!


If you see the stable-door setting open wide;

If you see a tired horse lying down inside;

If your mother mends a coat cut about and tore;

If the lining's wet and warm -- don't you ask no more!


If you meet King George's men, dressed in blue and red,

You be care full what you say, and mindful what is said.

If they call you "pretty maid," and chuck you 'neath the chin,

Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been!


Knocks and footsteps round the house -- whistles after dark --

You've no call for running out till the house-dogs bark.

Trusty's here, and Pincher's here, and see how dumb they lie --

They don't fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by!


If you do as you've been told, 'likely there's a chance,

You'll be given a dainty doll, all the way from France,

With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood --

A present from the Gentlemen, along o' being good!

Five and twenty ponies,

Trotting through the dark --

Brandy for the Parson,

'Baccy for the Clerk;

Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie --

Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

Poem 31: A Song in Storm


Be well assured that on our side

      The abiding oceans fight,

  Though headlong wind and heaping tide

      Make us their sport to-night.

  By force of weather, not of war,

      In jeopardy we steer.

  Then welcome Fate's discourtesy

     Whereby it shall appear

         How in all time of our distress,

         And our deliverance too,

         The game is more than the player of the game,

         And the ship is more than the crew!


  Out of the mist into the murk

      The glimmering combers roll.

  Almost these mindless waters work

      As though they had a soul --

  Almost as though they leagued to whelm

      Our flag beneath their green:

  Then welcome Fate's discourtesy

      Whereby it shall be seen, etc.


  Be well assured, though wave and wind

       Have mightier blows in store,

  That we who keep the watch assigned

       Must stand to it the more;

  And as our streaming bows rebuke

       Each billow's baulked career,

  Sing, welcome Fate's discourtesy

       Whereby it is made clear, etc.


  No matter though our decks be swept

       And mast and timber crack --

  We can make good all loss except

       The loss of turning back.

   So, 'twixt these Devils and our deep

       Let courteous trumpets sound,

  To welcome Fate's discourtesy

       Whereby it will be found, etc.


  Be well assured, though in our power

       Is nothing left to give

  But chance and place to meet the hour,

       And leave to strive to live.

  Till these dissolve our Order holds,

       Our Service binds us here.

  Then welcome Fate's discourtesy

       Whereby it is made clear

           How in all time of our distress,

           As in our triumph too,

           The game is more than the player of the game

Oh, light was the world that he weighed in his hands!

Oh, heavy the tale of his fiefs and his lands!

He has gone from the guddee and put on the shroud,

And departed in guise of bairagi avowed!


Now the white road to Delhi is mat for his feet.

The sal and the kikar must guard him from heat.

His home is the camp, and waste, and the crowd --

He is seeking the Way as bairagi avowed!


He has looked upon Man, and his eyeballs are clear --

(There was One; there is One, and but One, saith Kabir);

The Red Mist of Doing has thinned to a cloud --

He has taken the Path for bairagi avowed!


To learn and discern of his brother the clod,

Of his brother the brute, and his brother the God,

He has gone from the council and put on the shroud

("Can ye hear?" saith Kabir), a bairagi avowed!

Poem 34: Alnaschar and the Oxen


There's a pasture in a valley where the hanging woods divide,

And a Herd lies down and ruminates in peace;

Where the pheasant rules the nooning, and the owl the twilight tide,

And the war-cries of our world die out and cease.

Here I cast aside the burden that each weary week-day brings

And, delivered from the shadows I pursue,

On peaceful, postless, Sabbaths I consider Weighty Things

Such as Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew!

At the gate beside the river where the trouty shallows brawl,

I know the pride that Lobengula felt,

When he bade the bars be lowered of the Royal Cattle Kraal,

And fifteen miles of oxen took the veldt.

From the walls of Bulawayo in unbroken file they came

To where the Mount of Council cuts the blue . . .

I have only six and twenty, but the principle's the same

With my Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew!


To a luscious sound of tearing, where the clovered herbage rips,

Level-backed and level-bellied watch 'em move.

See those shoulders, guess that heart-girth, praise those loins, admire those hips,

And the tail set low for flesh to make above!

Count the broad unblemished muzzles, test the kindly mellow skin

And, where yon heifer lifts her head at call,

Mark the bosom's just abundance 'neath the gay and cleancut chin,

And those eyes of Juno, overlooking all!


Here is colour, form and substance, I will put it to the proof

And, next season, in my lodges shall be born

Some very Bull of Mithras, flawless from his agate hoof

To his even-branching ivory, dusk-tipped horn.

He shall mate with block-square virgins - kings shall seek his like in vain,

While I multiply his stock a thousandfold,

Till an hungry world extol me, builder of a lofty strain

That turns one standard ton at two years old.


There's a valley, under oakwood, where a man may dream his dream,

In the milky breath of cattle laid at ease,

Till the moon o'ertops the alders, and her image chills the stream,

And the river-mist runs silver round their knees!

Now the footpaths fade and vanish; now the ferny clumps deceive;

Now the hedgerow-folk possess their fields anew;

Now the Herd is lost in darkness, and I bless them as I leave,

My Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew!

Poem 35: An American


The American Spirit speaks:



"If the Led Striker call it a strike,

Or the papers call it a war,

They know not much what I am like,

Nor what he is, my Avatar."


Through many roads, by me possessed,

He shambles forth in cosmic guise;

He is the Jester and the Jest,

And he the Text himself applies.


The Celt is in his heart and hand,

The Gaul is in his brain and nerve;

Where, cosmopolitanly planned,

He guards the Redskin's dry reserve.


His easy unswept hearth he lends

From Labrador to Guadeloupe;

Till, elbowed out by sloven friends,

He camps, at sufferance, on the stoop.


Calm-eyed he scoffs at sword and crown,

Or panic-blinded stabs and slays:

Blatant he bids the world bow down,

Or cringing begs a crust of praise;


Or, sombre-drunk, at mine and mart,

He dubs his dreary brethren Kings.

His hands are black with blood -- his heart

Leaps, as a babe's, at little things.


But, through the shift of mood and mood,

Mine ancient humour saves him whole --

The cynic devil in his blood

That bids him mock his hurrying soul;


That bids him flout the Law he makes,

That bids him make the Law he flouts,

Till, dazed by many doubts, he wakes

The drumming guns that -- have no doubts;


That checks him foolish -- hot and fond,

That chuckles through his deepest ire,

That gilds the slough of his despond

But dims the goal of his desire;


Inopportune, shrill-accented,

The acrid Asiatic mirth

That leaves him, careless 'mid his dead,

The scandal of the elder earth.


How shall he clear himself, how reach

Your bar or weighed defence prefer?

A brother hedged with alien speech

And lacking all interpreter.


Which knowledge vexes him a space;

But while Reproof around him rings,

He turns a keen untroubled face

Home, to the instant need of things.


Enslaved, illogical, elate,

He greets th' embarrassed Gods, nor fears

To shake the iron hand of Fate

Or match with Destiny for beers.


Lo, imperturbable he rules,

Unkempt, disreputable, vast --

And, in the teeth of all the schools,

I -- I shall save him at the last!

O look and behold

The Planets that love us

All harnessed in gold!

What chariots, what horses

Against us shall bide

While the Stars in their courses

Do fight on our side?


All thought, all desires,

That are under the sun,

Are one with their fires,

As we also are one:

All matter, all spirit,

All fashion, all frame,

Receive and inherit

Their strength from the same.


(Oh, man that deniest

All power save thine own,

Their power in the highest

Is mightily shown.

Not less in the lowest

That power is made clear.

Oh, man, if thou knowest,

Earth quakes in her throes

And we wonder for why!

But the blind planet knows

When her ruler is nigh;

And, attuned since Creation

To perfect accord,

She thrills in her station

And yearns to her Lord.


The waters have risen,

The springs are unbound--

The floods break their prison,

And ravin around.

No rampart withstands 'em,

Their fury will last,

Till the Sign that commands 'em

Sinks low or swings past.


Through abysses unproven

And gulfs beyond thought,

Our portion is woven,

Our burden is brought.

Yet They that prepare it,

Whose Nature we share,

Make us who must bear it

Well able to bear.


Though terrors o'ertake us

We'll not be afraid.

No power can unmake us

Save that which has made.

Nor yet beyond reason

Or hope shall we fall--

All things have their season,

And Mercy crowns all!


Then, doubt not, ye fearful--

The Eternal is King--

Up, heart, and be cheerful,

And lustily sing:--

What chariots, what horses

Against us shall bide

While the Stars in their courses

Do fight on our side?

Poem 37: An Imperial Rescript


Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed,

To ease the strong of their burden, to help the weak in their need,

He sent a word to the peoples, who struggle, and pant, and sweat,

That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set.


The Lords of Their Hands assembled; from the East and the West they drew --

Baltimore, Lille, and Essen, Brummagem, Clyde, and Crewe.

And some were black from the furnace, and some were brown from the soil,

And some were blue from the dye-vat; but all were wearied of toil.


And the young King said: -- "I have found it, the road to the rest ye seek:

The strong shall wait for the weary, the hale shall halt for the weak;

With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line,

Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhood -- sign!"


The paper lay on the table, the strong heads bowed thereby,

And a wail went up from the peoples: -- "Ay, sign -- give rest, for we die!"

A hand was stretched to the goose-quill, a fist was cramped to scrawl,

When -- the laugh of a blue-eyed maiden ran clear through the council-hall.


And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain --

Saidie, Mimi, or Olga, Gretchen, or Mary Jane.

And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke;

And the men drew back from the paper, as a Yankee delegate spoke: --


"There's a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone;

We're going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own,

With gas and water connections, and steam-heat through to the top;

And, W. Hohenzollern, I guess I shall work till I drop."


And an English delegate thundered: -- "The weak an' the lame be blowed!

I've a berth in the Sou'-West workshops, a home in the Wandsworth Road;

And till the 'sociation has footed my buryin' bill,

I work for the kids an' the missus.  Pull up?  I be damned if I will!"


And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran: --

"Lager, der girls und der dollars, dey makes or dey breaks a man.

If Schmitt haf collared der dollars, he collars der girl deremit;

But if Schmitt bust in der pizness, we collars der girl from Schmitt."


They passed one resolution: -- "Your sub-committee believe

You can lighten the curse of Adam when you've lightened the curse of Eve.

But till we are built like angels, with hammer and chisel and pen,

We will work for ourself and a woman, for ever and ever, amen."


Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held --

The day that they razored the Grindstone, the day that the Cat was belled,

The day of the Figs from Thistles, the day of the Twisted Sands,

The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands.

 The tonga-horn shall ring,

So long as down the Solon dip

 The hard-held ponies swing,

So long as Tara Devi sees

 The lights of Simla town,

So long as Pleasure calls us up,

 Or Duty drives us down,

   If you love me as I love you

   What pair so happy as we two?


So long as Aces take the King,

 Or backers take the bet,

So long as debt leads men to wed,

 Or marriage leads to debt,

So long as little luncheons, Love,

 And scandal hold their vogue,

While there is sport at Annandale

 Or whisky at Jutogh,

   If you love me as I love you

   What knife can cut our love in two?


So long as down the rocking floor

 The raving polka spins,

So long as Kitchen Lancers spur

 The maddened violins,

So long as through the whirling smoke

 We hear the oft-told tale --

"Twelve hundred in the Lotteries,"

 And Whatshername for sale?

   If you love me as I love you

   We'll play the game and win it too.


So long as Lust or Lucre tempt

 Straight riders from the course,

So long as with each drink we pour

 Black brewage of Remorse,

So long as those unloaded guns

 We keep beside the bed,

Blow off, by obvious accident,

 The lucky owner's head,

   If you love me as I love you

   What can Life kill of Death undo?


So long as Death 'twixt dance and dance

 Chills best and bravest blood,

And drops the reckless rider down

 The rotten, rain-soaked khud,

So long as rumours from the North

 Make loving wives afraid,

So long as Burma takes the boy

 Or typhoid kills the maid,

   If you love me as I love you

   What knife can cut our love in two?


By all that lights our daily life

 Or works our lifelong woe,

From Boileaugunge to Simla Downs

 And those grim glades below,

Where, heedless of the flying hoof

 And clamour overhead,

Sleep, with the grey languor for guard

 Our very scornful Dead,

   If you love me as I love you

   All Earth is servant to us two!


By Docket, Billetdoux, and File,

 By Mountain, Cliff, and Fir,

By Fan and Sword and Office-box,

 By Corset, Plume, and Spur

By Riot, Revel, Waltz, and War,

 By Women, Work, and Bills,

By all the life that fizzes in

 The everlasting Hills,

   If you love me as I love you

   What pair so happy as we two?

Poem 39: Anchor Song


Heh!  Walk her round.  Heave, ah heave her short again!

Over, snatch her over, there, and hold her on the pawl.

Loose all sail, and brace your yards back and full --

Ready jib to pay her off and heave short all!

  Well, ah fare you well; we can stay no more with you, my love --

  Down, set down your liquor and your girl from off your knee;

        For the wind has come to say:

        "You must take me while you may,

      If you'd go to Mother Carey

      (Walk her down to Mother Carey!),

  Oh, we're bound to Mother Carey where she feeds her chicks at sea!"


Heh!  Walk her round.  Break, ah break it out o' that!

Break our starboard-bower out, apeak, awash, and clear.

Port -- port she casts, with the harbour-mud beneath her foot,

And that's the last o' bottom we shall see this year!

  Well, ah fare you well, for we've got to take her out again --

  Take her out in ballast, riding light and cargo-free.

      And it's time to clear and quit

      When the hawser grips the bitt,

  So we'll pay you with the foresheet and a promise from the sea!


Heh!  Tally on.  Aft and walk away with her!

Handsome to the cathead, now; O tally on the fall!

Stop, seize and fish, and easy on the davit-guy.

Up, well up the fluke of her, and inboard haul!

  Well, ah fare you well, for the Channel wind's took hold of us,

  Choking down our voices as we snatch the gaskets free.

      And it's blowing up for night,

      And she's dropping Light on Light,

  And she's snorting under bonnets for a breath of open sea,


Wheel, full and by; but she'll smell her road alone to-night.

Sick she is and harbour-sick -- O sick to clear the land!

Roll down to Brest with the old Red Ensign over us --

Carry on and thrash her out with all she'll stand!

  Well, ah fare you well, and it's Ushant slams the door on us,

  Whirling like a windmill through the dirty scud to lee:

        Till the last, last flicker goes

        From the tumbling water-rows,

      And we're off to Mother Carey

      (Walk her down to Mother Carey!),

  Oh, we're bound for Mother Carey where she feeds her chicks at sea!

Poem 40: Angutivaun Taina


Our gloves are stiff with the frozen blood,

 Our furs with the drifted snow,

As we come in with the seal--the seal!

 In from the edge of the floe.


Au jana! Aua! Oha! Haq!

 And the yelping dog-teams go;

And the long whips crack, and the men come back,

 Back from the edge of the floe!


We tracked our seal to his secret place,

 We heard him scratch below,

We made our mark, and we watched beside,

 Out on the edge of the floe.


We raised our lance when he rose to breathe,

 We drove it downward--so!

And we played him thus, and we killed him thus,

 Out on the edge of the floe.


Our gloves are glued with the frozen blood,

 Our eyes with the drifting snow;

But we come back to our wives again,

 Back from the edge of the floe!


Au jana! Aua! Oha! Haq!

 And the loaded dog-teams go;

And the wives ran hear their men come back,

 Back from the edge of the floe!

Poem 41: Arithmetic on the Frontier


A great and glorious thing it is

 To learn, for seven years or so,

The Lord knows what of that and this,

 Ere reckoned fit to face the foe --

The flying bullet down the Pass,

That whistles clear: "All flesh is grass."


Three hundred pounds per annum spent

 On making brain and body meeter

For all the murderous intent

 Comprised in "villanous saltpetre!"

And after -- ask the Yusufzaies

What comes of all our 'ologies.


A scrimmage in a Border Station --

 A canter down some dark defile --

Two thousand pounds of education

 Drops to a ten-rupee jezail --

The Crammer's boast, the Squadron's pride,

Shot like a rabbit in a ride!


No proposition Euclid wrote,

 No formulae the text-books know,

Will turn the bullet from your coat,

 Or ward the tulwar's downward blow

Strike hard who cares -- shoot straight who can --

The odds are on the cheaper man.


One sword-knot stolen from the camp

 Will pay for all the school expenses

Of any Kurrum Valley scamp

 Who knows no word of moods and tenses,

But, being blessed with perfect sight,

Picks off our messmates left and right.


With home-bred hordes the hillsides teem,

 The troop-ships bring us one by one,

At vast expense of time and steam,

 To slay Afridis where they run.

The "captives of our bow and spear"

Are cheap -- alas! as we are dear.

Poem 42: Army Headquarters


Old is the song that I sing --

Old as my unpaid bills --

Old as the chicken that kitmutgars bring

Men at dak-bungalows -- old as the Hills.  


Ahasuerus Jenkins of the "Operatic Own,"

Was dowered with a tenor voice of super-Santley tone.

His views on equitation were, perhaps, a trifle queer.

He had no seat worth mentioning, but oh! he had an ear.


He clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day;

He used to quit his charger in a parabolic way;

His method of saluting was the joy of all beholders,

But Ahasuerus Jenkins had a head upon his shoulders.


He took two months at Simla when the year was at the spring,

And underneath the deodars eternally did sing.

He warbled like a bul-bul but particularly at

Cornelia Agrippina, who was musical and fat.


She controlled a humble husband, who, in turn, controlled a Dept.

Where Cornelia Agrippina's human singing-birds were kept

From April to October on a plump retaining-fee,

Supplied, of course, per mensem, by the Indian Treasury.


Cornelia used to sing with him, and Jenkins used to play;

He praised unblushingly her notes, for he was false as they;

So when the winds of April turned the budding roses brown,

Cornelia told her husband: -- "Tom, you mustn't send him down."


They haled him from his regiment, which didn't much regret him;

They found for him an office-stool, and on that stool they set him

To play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day,

And draw his plump retaining-fee -- which means his double pay.


Now, ever after dinnger, when the coffee-cups are brought,

Ahasuerus waileth o'er the grand pianoforte;

And, thanks to fair Cornelia, his fame hath waxen great,

And Ahasuerus Jenkins is a Power in the State!

I


Frost upon small rain--the ebony-lacquered avenue

  Reflecting lamps as a pool shows goldfish.

The sight suddenly emptied out of the young man's eyes

  Entering upon it sideways.



                          II


In youth, by hazard, I killed an old man.

        In age I maimed a little child.

Dead leaves under foot reproach not:

But the lop-sided cherry-branch--whenever the sun rises,

Poem 44: As the Bell Clinks


As I left the Halls at Lumley, rose the vision of a comely

Maid last season worshipped dumbly, watched with fervor from afar;

And I wondered idly, blindly, if the maid would greet me kindly.

That was all -- the rest was settled by the clinking tonga-bar.

Yea, my life and hers were coupled by the tonga coupling-bar.


For my misty meditation, at the second changing-station,

Suffered sudden dislocation, fled before the tuneless jar

Of a Wagner obbligato, scherzo, doublehand staccato,

Played on either pony's saddle by the clacking tonga-bar --

Played with human speech, I fancied, by the jigging, jolting bar.


"She was sweet," thought I, "last season, but 'twere surely wild unreason

Such tiny hope to freeze on as was offered by my Star,

When she whispered, something sadly: 'I -- we feel your going badly!'"

"And you let the chance escape you?" rapped the rattling tonga-bar.

"What a chance and what an idiot!" clicked the vicious tonga-bar.


Heart of man -- O heart of putty! Had I gone by Kakahutti,

On the old Hill-road and rutty, I had 'scaped that fatal car.

But his fortune each must bide by, so I watched the milestones slide by,

To "You call on Her to-morrow!" -- no fugue with cymbals by the bar --

"You must call on Her to-morrow!" -- post-horn gallop by the bar.


Yet a further stage my goal on -- we were whirling down to Solon,

With a double lurch and roll on, best foot foremost, ganz und gar --

"She was very sweet," I hinted. "If a kiss had been imprinted?" --

"Would ha' saved a world of trouble!" clashed the busy tonga-bar.

"'Been accepted or rejected!" banged and clanged the tonga-bar.


Then a notion wild and daring, 'spite the income tax's paring,

And a hasty thought of sharing -- less than many incomes are,

Made me put a question private, you can guess what I would drive at.

"You must work the sum to prove it," clanked the careless tonga-bar.

"Simple Rule of Two will prove it," lilted back the tonga-bar.


It was under Khyraghaut I mused. "Suppose the maid be haughty --

There are lovers rich -- and forty -- wait some wealthy Avatar?

Answer, monitor untiring, 'twixt the ponies twain perspiring!"

"Faint heart never won fair lady," creaked the straining tonga-bar.

"Can I tell you ere you ask Her?" pounded slow the tonga-bar.


Last, the Tara Devi turning showed the lights of Simla burning,

Lit my little lazy yearning to a fiercer flame by far.

As below the Mall we jingled, through my very heart it tingled --

Did the iterated order of the threshing tonga-bar --

"Try your luck -- you can't do better!" twanged the loosened tongar-bar.

Poem 45: At His Execution


I am made all things to all men--

   Hebrew, Roman, and Greek--

   In each one's tongue I speal,

Suiting to each my word,

That some may be drawn to the Lord!


I am made all things to all men--

   In City or Wilderness

   Praising the crafts they profess

That some may be drawn to the Lord--

By any means to my Lord!


Since I was overcome

   By that great Light and Word,

   I have forgot or forgone

The self men call their own

(Being made all things to all men)

   So that I might save some

   At such small price, to the Lord,

As being all things to all men.


I was made all things to all men,

But now my course is done--

And now is my reward...

Ah, Christ, when I stand at Thy Throne

With those I have drawn to the Lord,

Restore me my self again!

Poem 46: Azrael's Count


Lo! The Wild Cow of the Desert, her yeanling estrayed from her --

Lost in the wind-plaited sand-dunes -- athirst in the maze of them.

Hot-foot she  follows those  foot-prints -- the  thrice-tangled ways of them.

Her soul is shut save to one thing -- the love-quest consuming her

Fearless she lows past the camp, our fires affright her not.

Ranges she close to the tethered  ones -- the  mares by  the lances held.

Noses she softly apart the veil in the women's tent.

Next -- withdrawn under moonlight, a shadow afar off --

Fades. Ere men cry, "Hold her fast! darkness recovers her.

She the all-crazed and forlorn, when the dogs threaten her,

Only a side-tossed horn, as though a fly troubled her,

Shows she hath heard, till a lance in the heart of her quivereth.

-- Lo, from that carcass aheap -- where speeds the soul of it?

Where is the tryst it must keep? Who is her pandar? Death!


Men I dismiss to the Mercy greet me not willingly;

Crying, "When seekest Thou me first?  Are not my kin unslain?

Shrinking aside from the Sword-edge, blinking the glare of it,

Sinking the chin in the neck-bone. How shall that profit them?

Yet, among men a ten thousand, few meet me otherwise.


Yet, among women a thousand, one comes to me mistress-wise.

Arms open, breasts open, mouth open -- hot is her need on her.

Crying, "Ho, Servant, acquit me, the bound by Love's promises!

Haste Thou! He Waits! I would go! Handle me lustily!"

Lo! her eyes stare past my wings, as things unbeheld by her.

Lo! her lips summoning part. I am not whom she calls!


Lo! My sword sinks and returns. At no time she heedeth it,

More than the dust of a journey, her garments brushed clear of it.

Lo! Ere the blood-gush has ceased, forward her soul rushes.

She is away to her tryst. Who is her pandar? Death!

Poem 47: Ballad of Fisher's Boarding-House


'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,

 Where sailor-men reside,

And there were men of all the ports

 From Mississip to Clyde,

And regally they spat and smoked,

 And fearsomely they lied.


They lied about the purple Sea

 That gave them scanty bread,

They lied about the Earth beneath,

 The Heavens overhead,

For they had looked too often on

 Black rum when that was red.


They told their tales of wreck and wrong,

 Of shame and lust and fraud,

They backed their toughest statements with

 The Brimstone of the Lord,

And crackling oaths went to and fro

 Across the fist-banged board.


And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,

 Bull-throated, bare of arm,

Who carried on his hairy chest

 The maid Ultruda's charm --

The little silver crucifix

 That keeps a man from harm.


And there was Jake Without-the-Ears,

 And Pamba the Malay,

And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,

 And Luz from Vigo Bay,

And Honest Jack who sold them slops

 And harvested their pay.


And there was Salem Hardieker,

 A lean Bostonian he --

Russ, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,

 Yank, Dane, and Portugee,

At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house

 They rested from the sea.


Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,

 Collinga knew her fame,

From Tarnau in Galicia

 To Juan Bazaar she came,

To eat the bread of infamy

 And take the wage of shame.


She held a dozen men to heel --

 Rich spoil of war was hers,

In hose and gown and ring and chain,

 From twenty mariners,

And, by Port Law, that week, men called

 Her Salem Hardieker's.


But seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --

 That neither gifts nor gain

Can hold a winking Light o' Love

 Or Fancy's flight restrain,

When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes

 On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.


Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,

 From Howrah to the Bay,

And he may die before the dawn

 Who liquored out the day,

In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house

 We woo while yet we may.


But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,

 Bull-throated, bare of arm,

And laughter shook the chest beneath

 The maid Ultruda's charm --

The little silver crucifix

 That keeps a man from harm.


"You speak to Salem Hardieker;

 "You was his girl, I know.

"I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,

 "Und round the Skaw we go,

"South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,

 "To Besser in Saro."


When love rejected turns to hate,

 All ill betide the man.

"You speak to Salem Hardieker" --

 She spoke as woman can.

A scream -- a sob -- "He called me -- names!"

 And then the fray began.


An oath from Salem Hardieker,

 A shriek upon the stairs,

A dance of shadows on the wall,

 A knife-thrust unawares --

And Hans came down, as cattle drop,

 Across the broken chairs.


. . . . . .


In Anne of Austria's trembling hands

 The weary head fell low: --

"I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight

 "For Besser in Saro;

"Und there Ultruda comes to me

 "At Easter, und I go


"South, down the Cattegat -- What's here?

 "There -- are -- no -- lights -- to guide!"

The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,

 And Anne of Austria cried

In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house

 When Hans the mighty died.


Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,

 Bull-throated, bare of arm,

But Anne of Austria looted first

 The maid Ultruda's charm --

The little silver crucifix

 That keeps a man from harm.

Poem 48: Banquet Night


"Once in so often," King Solomon said,

Watching his quarrymen drill the stone,

"We will curb our garlic and wine and bread

And banquet together beneath my Throne,

And all Brethren shall come to that mess

As Fellow-Craftsmen-no more and no less."


"Send a swift shallop to Hiram of Tyre,

Felling and floating our beautiful trees,

Say that the Brethren and I desire

Talk with our Brethren who use the seas.

And we shall be happy to meet them at mess

As Fellow-Craftsmen-no more and no less."


"Carry this message to Hiram Abif-

Excellent master of forge and mine :-

I and the Brethren would like it if

He and the Brethren will come to dine

(Garments from Bozrah or morning-dress)

As Fellow-Craftsmen-no more and no less."


"God gave the Cedar their place-

Also the Bramble, the Fig and the Thorn-

But that is no reason to black a man's face

Because he is not what he hasn't been born.

And, as touching the Temple, I hold and profess

We are Fellow-Craftsmen-no more and no less."


So it was ordered and so it was done,

And the hewers of wood and the Masons of Mark,

With foc'sle hands of Sidon run

And Navy Lords from the ROYAL ARK,

Came and sat down and were merry at mess

As Fellow-Craftsmen-no more and no less.


The Quarries are hotter than Hiram's forge,

No one is safe from the dog-whip's reach.

It's mostly snowing up Lebanon gorge,

And it's always blowing off Joppa beach;


But once in so often, the messenger brings

Solomon's mandate : "Forget these things!

Brother to Beggars and Fellow to Kings,

Companion of Princes-forget these things!

Fellow-Craftsmen, forget these things!"

Poem 50: Beast and Man in India


They  killed a Child to please the Gods

In Earth's young penitence,

And I have bled in that Babe's stead

Because of innocence.


I bear the sins of sinful men

That have no sin of my own,

They drive me forth to Heaven's wrath

Unpastured and alone.


I am the meat of sacrifice,        

The ransom of man's guilt,

For they give my life to the altar-knife

Wherever shrine is built.


                              The Goat.



Between the waving tufts of jungle-grass,

Up from the river as the twilight falls,

Across the dust-beclouded plain they pass

On to the village walls.


Great is the sword and mighty is the pen,

But over all the labouring ploughman's blade--

For on its oxen and its husbandmen

An Empire's strength is laid.


                           The Oxen.



The torn boughs trailing o'er the tusks aslant,

The saplings reeling in the path he trod,

Declare his might--our lord the Elephant,  

Chief of the ways of God.


The black bulk heaving where the oxen pant,

The bowed head toiling where the guns careen,

Declare our might--our slave the Elephant,

And servant of the Queen.


                           The Elephant.



Dark children of the mere and marsh,

Wallow and waste and lea,

Outcaste they wait at the village gate

With folk of low degree.


Their pasture is in no man's land,

Their food the cattle's scorn;

Their rest is mire and their desire

The thicket and the thorn.


But woe to those that break their sleep,

And woe to those that dare

To rouse the herd-bull from his keep,

The wild boar from his lair!


                                Pigs and Buffaloes.



The beasts are very wise,

Their mouths are clean of lies,

They talk one to the other,

Bullock to bullock's brother

Resting after their labours,

Each in stall with his neighbours.

But man with goad and whip,

Breaks up their fellowship,

Shouts in their silky ears

Filling their soul with fears.

When he has ploughed the land,

He says:  "They understand."

But the beasts in stall together,

Freed from the yoke and tether,

Say as the torn flanks smoke:

"Nay, 'twas the whip that spoke."

Poem 51: Before a Midnight Breaks in Storm


Before a midnight breaks in storm,

 Or herded sea in wrath,

Ye know what wavering gusts inform

 The greater tempest's path;

   Till the loosed wind

   Drive all from mind,

Except Distress, which, so will prophets cry,

O'ercame them, houseless, from the unhinting sky.


Ere rivers league against the land

 In piratry of flood,    

Ye know what waters steal and stand

 Where seldom water stood.  

  Yet who will note,      

  Till fields afloat,                          

And washen carcass and the returning well,

Trumpet what these poor heralds strove to tell?


Ye know who use the Crystal Ball

 (To peer by stealth on Doom),    

The Shade that, shaping first of all,

 Prepares an empty room.

   Then doth It pass        

   Like breath from glass,

But, on the extorted Vision bowed intent,

No man considers why It came or went.


Before the years reborn behold

 Themselves with stranger eye,

And the sport-making Gods of old,

 Like Samson slaying, die,            

   Many shall hear

   The all-pregnant sphere,

Bow to the birth and sweat, but--speech denied--

Sit dumb or--dealt in part--fall weak and wide.


Yet instant to fore-shadowed need

 The eternal balance swings;

That winged men, the Fates may breed

 So soon as Fate hath wings.

   These shall possess

   Our littleness,

And in the imperial task (as worthy) lay

Up our lives' all to piece one giant Day.

Poem 52: Belts


There was a row in Silver Street that's near to Dublin Quay,

Between an Irish regiment an' English cavalree;

It started at Revelly an' it lasted on till dark:

Poem 53: Big Steamers


1914-18



"Oh, where are you going to, all you Big Steamers,

  With England's own coal, up and down the salt seas?"

"We are going to fetch you your bread and your butter,

  Your beef, pork, and mutton, eggs, apples, and cheese."


"And where will you fetch it from, all you Big Steamers,

  And where shall I write you when you are away?

"We fetch it from Melbourne, Quebec, and Vancouver--

  Address us at Hobart,  Hong-Kong, and Bombay."


"But if anything happened to  all you  Big  Steamers,

  And suppose  you were  wrecked  up  and  down  the  salt sea?"

"Then you'd have no coffee or bacon for breakfast,

  And you'd have no muffins or toast for your tea."


"Then I'll pray for fine weather for all you Big Steamers,

  For little blue billows and breezes so soft."

"Oh, billows and breezes don't bother Big Steamers,

  For we're iron below and steel-rigging aloft."


"Then I'll build a new lighthouse for all you Big Steamers,

  With plenty wise pilots to pilot you through."

"Oh, the Channel's as bright as a ball-room already,

  And pilots are thicker than pilchards at Looe."


"Then what can I do for you, all you Big Steamers,

  Oh, what can I do for your comfort and good?"

"Send out your big  warships to watch your big waters,

  That no one may stop us from bringing you food.


"For the bread that you eat and the biscuits you nibble,

The sweets that you suck and the joints that you carve,

They are brought to you daily by all us Big Steamers--

And if one hinders our coming you'll starve!"

Poem 56: Blue Roses


Roses red and roses white

Plucked I for my love's delight.

She would none of all my posies--

Bade me gather her blue roses.


Half the world I wandered through,

Seeking where such flowers grew.

Half the world unto my quest

Answered me with laugh and jest.


Home I came at wintertide,

But my silly love had died

Seeking with her latest breath

Roses from the arms of Death.


It may be beyond the grave

She shall find what she would have.

Mine was but an idle quest--


Roses white and red are best!

With a smile round both 'is ears --

Poem 59: Bridge-Guard in the Karroo


Sudden the desert changes,

 The raw glare softens and clings,

Till the aching Oudtshoorn ranges

 Stand up like the thrones of Kings --


Ramparts of slaughter and peril --

 Blazing, amazing, aglow --

'Twixt the sky-line's belting beryl

 And the wine-dark flats below.


Royal the pageant closes,

 Lit by the last of the sun --

Opal and ash-of-roses,

 Cinnamon, umber, and dun.


The twilight swallows the thicket,

 The starlight reveals the ridge.

The whistle shrills to the picket --

 We are changing guard on the bridge.


(Few, forgotten and lonely,

 Where the empty metals shine --

No, not combatants-only

 Details guarding the line.)


We slip through the broken panel

 Of fence by the ganger's shed;

We drop to the waterless channel

 And the lean track overhead;


We stumble on refuse of rations,

 The beef and the biscuit-tins;

We take our appointed stations,

 And the endless night begins.


We hear the Hottentot herders

 As the sheep click past to the fold --

And the click of the restless girders

 As the steel contracts in the cold --


Voices of jackals calling

 And, loud in the hush between,

A morsel of dry earth falling

 From the flanks of the scarred ravine.


And the solemn firmament marches,

 And the hosts of heaven rise

Framed through the iron arches --

 Banded and barred by the ties,


Till we feel the far track humming,

 And we see her headlight plain,

And we gather and wait her coming --

 The wonderful north-bound train.


(Few, forgotten and lonely,

 Where the white car-windows shine --

No, not combatants-only

 Details guarding the line.)


Quick, ere the gift escape us!

 Out of the darkness we reach

For a handful of week-old papers

 And a mouthful of human speech.


And the monstrous heaven rejoices,

 And the earth allows again,

Meetings, greetings, and voices

 Of women talking with men.


So we return to our places,

 As out on the bridge she rolls;

And the darkness covers our faces,

 And the darkness re-enters our souls.


More than a little lonely

 Where the lessening tail-lights shine.

No - not combatants - only

 Details guarding the line!

Poem 60: Brookland Road


I was very well pleased with what I knowed,

I reckoned myself no fool --

Till I met with a maid on the Brookland Road,

That turned me back to school.              


Low down-low down!

Where the liddle green lanterns shine --

O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one,

And she can never be mine!


'Twas right in the middest of a hot June night,

With thunder duntin' round,

And I see her face by the fairy-light

That beats from off the ground.


She only smiled and she never spoke,

She smiled and went away;

But when she'd gone my heart was broke

And my wits was clean astray.


O, stop your ringing and let me be --

Let be, O Brookland bells!

You'll ring Old Goodman out of the sea,

Before I wed one else!


Old Goodman's Farm is rank sea-sand,

And was this thousand year;

But it shall turn to rich plough-land

Before I change my dear.


O, Fairfield Church is water-bound

From autumn to the spring;

But it shall turn to high hill-ground

Before my bells do ring.


O, leave me walk on Brookland Road,

In the thunder and warm rain --

O, leave me look where my love goed,

And p'raps I'll see her again!


Low down -- low down!

Where the liddle green lanterns shine --

O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one,

And she can never be mine!

Poem 61: Brown Bess


In the days of lace-ruffles, perukes and brocade

 Brown Bess was a partner whom none could despise--

An out-spoken, flinty-lipped, brazen-faced jade,

 With a habit of looking men straight in the eyes--

At Blenheim and Ramillies fops would confess

They were pierced to the heart by the charms of Brown Bess.


Though her sight was not long and her weight was not small,

 Yet her actions were winning, her language was clear;

And everyone bowed as she opened the ball

 On the arm of some high-gaitered, grim grenadier.

Half Europe admitted the striking success

Of the dances and routs that were given by Brown Bess.


When ruffles were turned into stiff leather stocks,

  And people wore pigtails instead of perukes,

Brown Bess never altered her iron-grey locks.

 She knew she was valued for more than her looks.

"Oh, powder and patches was always my dress,

And I think am killing enough," said Brown Bess.


So she followed her red-coats, whatever they did,

 From the heights of Quebec to the plains of Assaye,

From Gibraltar to Acre, Cape Town and Madrid,

 And nothing about her was changed on the way;

(But most of the Empire which now we possess

Was won through those years by old-fashioned Brown Bess.)


In stubborn retreat or in stately advance,

 From the Portugal coast to the cork-woods of Spain,

She had puzzled some excellent Marshals of France

 Till none of them wanted to meet her again:

But later, near Brussels, Napoleon--no less--

Arranged for a Waterloo ball with Brown Bess.


She had danced till the dawn of that terrible day--

  She danced till the dusk of more terrible night,

And before her linked squares his battalions gave way,

  And her long fierce quadrilles put his lancers to flight:

And when his gilt carriage drove off in the press,  

"I have danced my last dance for the world!" said Brown Bess.


If you go to Museums--there's one in Whitehall--

 Where old weapons are shown with their names writ beneath,

You will find her, upstanding, her back to the wall,

 As stiff as a ramrod, the flint in her teeth.

And if ever we English had reason to bless

Any arm save our mothers', that arm is Brown Bess!

Poem 62: Buddha at Kamakura


One who treated the Narrow Way

By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,

Be gentle when "the heathen" pray

 To Buddha at Kamakura!


To him the Way, the Law, apart,

Whom Maya held beneath her heart,

Ananda's Lord, the Bodhisat,

 The Buddha of Kamakura.


For though he neither burns nor sees,

Nor hears ye thank your Deities,

Ye have not sinned with such as these,

 His children at Kamakura,


Yet spare us still the Western joke

When joss-sticks turn to scented smoke

The little sins of little folk

 That worship at Kamakura --


The grey-robed, gay-sashed butterflies

That flit beneath the Master's eyes.

He is beyond the Mysteries

 But loves them at Kamakura.


And whoso will, from Pride released,

Contemning neither creed nor priest,

May feel the Soul of all the East

 About him at Kamakura.


Yea, every tale Ananda heard,

Of birth as fish or beast or bird,

While yet in lives the Master stirred,

 The warm wind brings Kamakura.


Till drowsy eyelids seem to see

A-flower 'neath her golden htee

The Shwe-Dagon flare easterly

 From Burmah to Kamakura,


And down the loaded air there comes

The thunder of Thibetan drums,

And droned -- "Om mane padme hums" --

 A world's-width from Kamakura.


Yet Brahmans rule Benares still,

Buddh-Gaya's ruins pit the hill,

And beef-fed zealots threaten ill

 To Buddha and Kamakura.


A tourist-show, a legend told,

A rusting bulk of bronze and gold,

S o much, and scarce so much, ye hold

 The meaning of Kamakura?


But when the morning prayer is prayed,

Think, ere ye pass to strife and trade,

Is God in human image made

 No nearer than Kamakura.

Poem 63: Butterflies


Eyes aloft, over dangerous places,

The children follow the butterflies,

And, in the sweat of their upturned faces,

Slash with a net at the empty skies.


So it goes they fall amid brambles,

And sting their toes on the nettle-tops,

Till, after a thousand scratches and scrambles,

They wipe their brows and the hunting stops.


Then to quiet them comes their father

And stills the riot of pain and grief,

Saying,  "Little ones,  go and gather

Out of my garden a cabbage-leaf.


"You will find on it whorls and clots of

Dull grey eggs that, properly fed,

Turn, by way of the worm, to lots of

Glorious butterflies raised from the dead."  .  .  .


"Heaven is beautiful, Earth is ugly,"

The three-dimensioned preacher saith;

So we must not look where the snail and the slug lie

For Psyche's birth.  .  .  .  And that is our death!

Poem 68: Cain and Abel


Cain and Abel were brothers born.

(Koop-la! Come along, cows!)


One raised cattle and one raised corn.

(Koop-la! Come along! Co-hoe!)


And Cain he farmed by the river-side,

So he did not care how much it dried.


For he banked, and he sluiced, and he ditched and he led

(And the Corn don't care for the Horn)--


A-half Euphrates out of her bed

 To water his dam' Corn!


But Abel herded out on the plains

Where you have to go by the dams and rains.


It happened, after a three-year drought,

The wells, and the springs, and the dams gave out.


The Herd-bulls came to Cain's new house

(They wanted water so!--)

With the hot red Sun between their brows,

Sayin' "Give us water for our pore cows!"

 But Cain he told 'em--"No!"


The Cows they came to Cain's big house

With the cold white Moon between their brows,

Sayin' "Give some water to us pore cows!"

  But Cain he told 'em--"No?"


The li'l Calves came to Cain's fine house

With the Evenin' Star between their brows,

Sayin' "'Give us water an' we'll be cows."

  But Cain he told 'em--"No!"


The Herd-bulls led 'em back again,

An' Abel went an' said to Cain: --

"Oh  sell me water, my brother dear,

Or there will be no beef this year."

 And Cain he answered--"No! "


"Then draw your hatches, my brother true,

An' let a little water through."

 But Cain he answered: -"No!


"My dams are tight an' my ditches are sound,

An' not a drop goes through or round

 Till she's done her duty by the Corn.


"I will not sell, an' I will not draw,

An' if you breach, I'll have the Law,

  As sure as you are borne! "


Then Abel took his best bull-goad,

An' holed a dyke on the Eden road.


He opened her up with foot an' hand,

An' let Euphrates loose on the land.


He spilled Euphrates out on the plain,

So's all his cattle could drink again.


Then Cain he saw what Abel done--

But, in those days, there was no Gun!


So he made him a club of a hickory-limb,

An' halted Abel an' said to him: --


"I did not sell an' I did not draw,

An' now  you've breached I'll have the Law.


"You ride abroad in your hat and spurs,

Hell-hoofin' over my cucumbers!


"You pray to the Lord to send you luck

An' you loose your steers in my garden-truck:


"An' now you're bust, as you ought to be,

You can keep on prayin' but not to me!"


Then Abel saw it meant the life;

But, in those days, there was no Knife:


So he up with his big bull-goad instead,

But--Cain hit first and dropped him dead!


The Herd-bulls ran when they smelt the blood,

An' horned an' pawed in that Red Mud.

The Calves they bawled, and the Steers they milled,

Because it was the First Man Killed;

An' the whole Herd broke for the Land of Nod,

An' Cain was left to be judged by God!


But, seein' all he had had to bear,

I never could call the Judgment fair!

     Such as delight in dust collected--

   Until arrives (I too have raced! )

     The unexpected.


   What ox not doomed to die alone,

     Or inauspicious hound, may bring

   Thee 'twixt two kisses to the throne

     Of Hades' King,

     No warning ere their bolts arrive.

I've a head like a concertina:  I've a tongue like a button-stick:

But I've had my fun o' the Corp'ral's Guard:  I've made the cinders fly,

I started o' canteen porter, I finished o' canteen beer,

But a dose o' gin that a mate slipped in, it was that that brought me here.

'Twas that and an extry double Guard that rubbed my nose in the dirt;

But I fell away with the Corp'ral's stock

          and the best of the Corp'ral's shirt.


I left my cap in a public-house, my boots in the public road,

And Lord knows where, and I don't care, my belt and my tunic goed;

They'll stop my pay, they'll cut away the stripes I used to wear,

But I left my mark on the Corp'ral's face, and I think he'll keep it there!

It ain't that I mind the Ord'ly room -- it's ~that~ that cuts so hard.

I'll take my oath before them both that I will sure abstain,

But as soon as I'm in with a mate and gin, I know I'll do it again!

Poem 71: Certain Maxims of Hafiz


I.


If It be pleasant to look on, stalled in the packed serai,

Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy?

If She be pleasant to look on, what does the Young Man say?

"Lo! She is pleasant to look on, give Her to me to-day!"



                               II.


Yea, though a Kafir die, to him is remitted Jehannum

If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent. per anuum.



                               III.


Blister we not for bursati? So when the heart is vexed,

The pain of one maiden's refusal is drowned in the pain of the next.



                               IV.


The temper of chums, the love of your wife, and a new piano's tune --

Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June?



                                V.


Who are the rulers of Ind -- to whom shall we bow the knee?

Make your peace with the women, and men will make you L. G.



                                VI.


Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash?

 Does grass clothe a new-built wall?

Is she under thirty, the woman who holds a boy in her thrall?



                                VII.


If She grow suddenly gracious -- reflect. Is it all for thee?

The black-buck is stalked through the bullock, and Man through jealousy.



                                VIII.


Seek not for favor of women. So shall you find it indeed.

Does not the boar break cover just when you're lighting a weed?



                                 IX.


If He play, being young and unskilful, for shekels of silver and gold,

Take his money, my son, praising Allah. The kid was ordained to be sold.



                                  X.


With a "weed" amoung men or horses verily this is the best,

That you work him in office or dog-cart lightly -- but give him no rest.



                                  XI.


Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship, improving the manners and carriage;

But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thorn-bit of Marriage.



                                  XII.


As the thriless gold of the babul, so is the gold that we spend

On a derby Sweep, or our neighbor's wife, or the horse that we buy from a friend.



                                  XIII.


The ways of man with a maid be strange, yet simple and tame

To the ways of a man with a horse, when selling or racing that same.



                                   XIV.


In public Her face turneth to thee, and pleasant Her smile when ye meet.

It is ill. The cold rocks of El-Gidar smile thus on the waves at their feet.

In public Her face is averted, with anger She nameth thy name.

It is well. Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?



                                    XV.


If She have spoken a word, remember thy lips are sealed,

And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed.

If She have written a letter, delay not an instant, but burn it.

Tear it to pieces, O Fool, and the wind to her mate shall return it!

If there be trouble to Herward, and a lie of the blackest can clear,

Lie, while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear.



                                    XVI.


My Son, if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give o'er,            

Yet lip meets with lip at the last word -- get out!

 She has been there before.

They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore.



                                    XVII.


If we fall in the race, though we win, the hoff-slide is scarred on the course.

Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin, remaineth forever Remorse.



                                    XVIII.


"By all I am misunderstood!" if the Matron shall say, or the Maid:

"Alas! I do not understand," my son, be thou nowise afraid.

In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed.



                                      XIX.


My son, if I, Hafiz, thy father, take hold of thy knees in my pain,

Demanding thy name on stamped paper, one day or one hour -- refrain.

Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another man's chain?

Poem 72: Chant-Pagan


ENGLISH IRREGULAR, DISCHARGED



Me that 'ave been what I've been --

 Me that 'ave gone where I've gone --

Me that 'ave seen what I've seen --

 'Ow can I ever take on

With awful old England again,

An' 'ouses both sides of the street,

And 'edges two sides of the lane,

And the parson an' gentry between,

An' touchin' my 'at when we meet --

 Me that 'ave been what I've been?


Me that 'ave watched 'arf a world

'Eave up all shiny with dew,

Kopje on kop to the sun,

An' as soon as the mist let 'em through

Our 'elios winkin' like fun --

Three sides of a ninety-mile square,

Over valleys as big as a shire --

"Are ye there? Are ye there? Are ye there?"

An' then the blind drum of our fire . . .

An' I'm rollin' 'is lawns for the Squire,

Me!


Me htat 'ave rode through the dark

Forty mile, often, on end,

Along the Ma'ollisberg Range,

With only the stars for my mark

An' only the night for my friend,

An' things runnin' off as you pass,

An' things jumpin' up in the grass,

An' the silence, the shine an' the size

Of the 'igh, unexpressible skies --

I am takin' some letters almost

As much as a mile to the post,

An' "mind you come back with the change!"

Me!


Me that saw Barberton took

When we dropped through the clouds on their 'ead,

An' they 'ove the guns over and fled --

Me that was through Di'mond I'll,

An' Pieters an' Springs an' Belfast --

From Dundee to Vereeniging all --

Me that stuck out to the last

(An' five bloomin' bars on my chest) --

I am doin' my Sunday-school best,

By the 'elp of the Squire an' 'is wife

(Not to mention the 'ousemaid an' cook),

To come in an' 'ands up an' be still,

An' honestly work for my bread,

My livin' in that state of life

To which it shall please God to call

Me!


Me that 'ave followed my trade

In the place where the Lightnin's are made;

"Twixt the Rains and the Sun and the Moon --

Me that lay down an' got up

Three years with the sky for my roof --

That 'ave ridden my 'unger an' thirst

Six thousand raw mile on the hoof,

With the Vaal and the Orange for cup,

An' the Brandwater Basin for dish, --

Oh! it's 'ard to be'ave as they wish

(Too 'ard, an' a little too soon),

I'll 'ave to think over it first --

Me!


I will arise an' get 'ence --

I will trek South and make sure

If it's only my fancy or not

That the sunshine of England is pale,

And the breezes of England are stale,

An' there's something' gone small with the lot.

For I know of a sun an' a wind,

An' some plains and a mountain be'ind,

An' some graves by a barb-wire fence,

An' a Dutchman I've fought 'oo might give

Me a job where I ever inclined

To look in an' offsaddle an' live

Where there's neither a road nor a tree --

But only my Maker an' me,

An I think it will kill me or cure,

So I think I will go there an' see.

Poem 73: Cholera Camp


We've got the cholerer in camp -- it's worse than forty fights;

We're dyin' in the wilderness the same as Isrulites;

It's before us, an' be'ind us, an' we cannot get away,

An' the doctor's just reported we've ten more to-day!


    Oh, strike your camp an' go, the Bugle's callin',

        The Rains are fallin' --

    The dead are bushed an' stoned to keep 'em safe below;

    The Band's a-doin' all she knows to cheer us;

    The Chaplain's gone and prayed to Gawd to 'ear us --

        To 'ear us --

    O Lord, for it's a-killin' of us so!


Since August, when it started, it's been stickin' to our tail,

Though they've 'ad us out by marches an' they've 'ad us back by rail;

But it runs as fast as troop-trains, and we cannot get away;

An' the sick-list to the Colonel makes ten more to-day.


There ain't no fun in women nor there ain't no bite to drink;

It's much too wet for shootin', we can only march and think;

An' at evenin', down the ~nullahs~, we can 'ear the jackals say,

"Get up, you rotten beggars, you've ten more to-day!"


'Twould make a monkey cough to see our way o' doin' things --

Lieutenants takin' companies an' captains takin' wings,

An' Lances actin' Sergeants -- eight file to obey --

For we've lots o' quick promotion on ten deaths a day!


Our Colonel's white an' twitterly -- 'e gets no sleep nor food,

But mucks about in 'orspital where nothing does no good.

'E sends us 'eaps o' comforts, all bought from 'is pay --

But there aren't much comfort 'andy on ten deaths a day.


Our Chaplain's got a banjo, an' a skinny mule 'e rides,

An' the stuff 'e says an' sings us, Lord, it makes us split our sides!

With 'is black coat-tails a-bobbin' to ~Ta-ra-ra Boom-der-ay!~

'E's the proper kind o' ~padre~ for ten deaths a day.


An' Father Victor 'elps 'im with our Roman Catholicks --

He knows an 'eap of Irish songs an' rummy conjurin' tricks;

An' the two they works together when it comes to play or pray;

So we keep the ball a-rollin' on ten deaths a day.


We've got the cholerer in camp -- we've got it 'ot an' sweet;

It ain't no Christmas dinner, but it's 'elped an' we must eat.

We've gone beyond the funkin', 'cause we've found it doesn't pay,

An' we're rockin' round the Districk on ten deaths a day!


    Then strike your camp an' go, the Rains are fallin',

        The Bugle's callin'!

    The dead are bushed an' stoned to keep 'em safe below!

    An' them that do not like it they can lump it,

    An' them that cannot stand it they can jump it;

    We've got to die somewhere -- some way -- some'ow --

    We might as well begin to do it now!

    Then, Number One, let down the tent-pole slow,

    Knock out the pegs an' 'old the corners -- so!

    Fold in the flies, furl up the ropes, an' stow!

    Oh, strike -- oh, strike your camp an' go!

        (Gawd 'elp us!)

Poem 74: Christmas in India


Dim dawn behind the tamerisks -- the sky is saffron-yellow --

 As the women in the village grind the corn,

And the parrots seek the riverside, each calling to his fellow

 That the Day, the staring Easter Day is born.

   Oh the white dust on the highway! Oh the stenches in the byway!

     Oh the clammy fog that hovers

   And at Home they're making merry 'neath the white and scarlet berry --

     What part have India's exiles in their mirth?


Full day begind the tamarisks -- the sky is blue and staring --

 As the cattle crawl afield beneath the yoke,

And they bear One o'er the field-path, who is past all hope or caring,

 To the ghat below the curling wreaths of smoke.

   Call on Rama, going slowly, as ye bear a brother lowly --

     Call on Rama -- he may hear, perhaps, your voice!

   With our hymn-books and our psalters we appeal to other altars,

     And to-day we bid "good Christian men rejoice!"


High noon behind the tamarisks -- the sun is hot above us --

 As at Home the Christmas Day is breaking wan.

They will drink our healths at dinner -- those who tell us how they love us,

 And forget us till another year be gone!

   Oh the toil that knows no breaking! Oh the Heimweh, ceaseless, aching!

     Oh the black dividing Sea and alien Plain!

   Youth was cheap -- wherefore we sold it.

     Gold was good -- we hoped to hold it,

   And to-day we know the foulness of our gain.


Grey dusk behind the tamarisks -- the parrots fly together --

 As the sun is sinking slowly over Home;

And his last ray seems to mock us shackled in a lifelong tether.

 That drags us back how'er so far we roam.

   Hard her service, poor her payment -- she is ancient, tattered raiment --

     India, she the grim Stepmother of our kind.

   If a year of life be lent her, if her temple's shrine we enter,

     The door is hut -- we may not look behind.


Black night behind the tamarisks -- the owls begin their chorus --

 As the conches from the temple scream and bray.

With the fruitless years behind us, and the hopeless years before us,

 Let us honor, O my brother, Christmas Day!

   Call a truce, then, to our labors -- let us feast with friends and neighbors,

     And be merry as the custom of our caste;

   For if "faint and forced the laughter," and if sadness follow after,

     We are richer by one mocking Christmas past.

Poem 75: Cities and Thrones and Powers


Cities and Thrones and Powers,

            Stand  in Time's eye,

        Almost as long as flowers,

          Which daily die:

        But, as new buds put forth

          To glad new men,

        Out of the spent and unconsidered Earth,

            The Cities rise again.


         This season's Daffodil,

            She never hears,

         What change, what chance, what chill,

            Cut down last year's;

         But with bold countenance,

            And  knowledge small,

         Esteems her seven days' continuance,

             To be perpetual.


           So Time that is o'er -kind,

              To all that be,

            Ordains us e'en as blind,

             As bold as she:

           That in our very death,

             And  burial sure,

           Shadow to shadow, well persuaded, saith,

               "See how our works endure!"

Poem 76: Cleared


Help for a patriot distressed, a spotless spirit hurt,

Help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt!

From Queenstown Bay to Donegal, O listen to my song,

The honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong.


Their noble names were mentioned -- O the burning black disgrace! --

By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shooting-case;

They sat upon it for a year, then steeled their heart to brave it,

And "coruscating innocence" the learned Judges gave it.


Bear witness, Heaven, of that grim crime beneath the surgeon's knife,

The honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life!

Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger,

No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger!


Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies,

Like ph]oenixes from Ph]oenix Park (and what lay there) they rise!

Go shout it to the emerald seas -- give word to Erin now,

Her honourable gentlemen are cleared -- and this is how: --


They only paid the Moonlighter his cattle-hocking price,

They only helped the murderer with counsel's best advice,

But -- sure it keeps their honour white -- the learned Court believes

They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves.


They never told the ramping crowd to card a woman's hide,

They never marked a man for death -- what fault of theirs he died? --

They only said "intimidate", and talked and went away --

By God, the boys that did the work were braver men than they!


Their sin it was that fed the fire -- small blame to them that heard --

The "bhoys" get drunk on rhetoric, and madden at a word --

They knew whom they were talking at, if they were Irish too,

The gentlemen that lied in Court, they knew, and well they knew.


They only took the Judas-gold from Fenians out of jail,

They only fawned for dollars on the blood-dyed Clanna-Gael.

If black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,

They're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown.


"Cleared", honourable gentlemen!  Be thankful it's no more: --

The widow's curse is on your house, the dead are at your door.

On you the shame of open shame, on you from North to South

The hand of every honest man flat-heeled across your mouth.


"Less black than we were painted"? -- Faith, no word of black was said;

The lightest touch was human blood, and that, you know, runs red.

It's sticking to your fist to-day for all your sneer and scoff,

And by the Judge's well-weighed word you cannot wipe it off.


Hold up those hands of innocence -- go, scare your sheep together,

The blundering, tripping tups that bleat behind the old bell-wether;

And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen,

Tell them it's tar that glistens so, and daub them yours again!


"The charge is old"? -- As old as Cain -- as fresh as yesterday;

Old as the Ten Commandments -- have ye talked those laws away?

If words are words, or death is death, or powder sends the ball,

You spoke the words that sped the shot -- the curse be on you all.


"Our friends believe"? -- Of course they do -- as sheltered women may;

But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay?

They! -- If their own front door is shut,

 they'll swear the whole world's warm;

What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm?


The secret half a county keeps, the whisper in the lane,

The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane,

The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees,

And shows the "bhoys" have heard your talk -- what do they know of these?


But you -- you know -- ay, ten times more; the secrets of the dead,

Black terror on the country-side by word and whisper bred,

The mangled stallion's scream at night, the tail-cropped heifer's low.

Who set the whisper going first?  You know, and well you know!


My soul!  I'd sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight,

Pure crime I'd done with my own hand for money, lust, or hate,

Than take a seat in Parliament by fellow-felons cheered,

While one of those "not provens" proved me cleared as you are cleared.


Cleared -- you that "lost" the League accounts -- go, guard our honour still,

Go, help to make our country's laws that broke God's law at will --

One hand stuck out behind the back, to signal "strike again";

The other on your dress-shirt-front to show your heart is clane.


If black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,

You're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown.

If print is print or words are words, the learned Court perpends: --

We are not ruled by murderers, but only -- by their friends.

Poem 77: Cold Iron


Gold is for the mistress -- silver for the maid --

Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade.

"Good!" said the Baron, sitting in his hall,

"But Iron -- Cold Iron -- is master of them all."


So he made rebellion 'gainst the King his liege,

Camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege.

"Nay!" said the cannoneer on the castle wall,

"But Iron -- Cold Iron -- shall be master of you all!"


Woe for the Baron and his knights so strong,

When the cruel cannon-balls laid 'em all along;

He was taken prisoner, he was cast in thrall,

And Iron -- Cold Iron -- was master of it all!


Yet his King spake kindly (ah, how kind a Lord!)

"What if I release thee now and give thee back thy sword?"

"Nay!" said the Baron, "mock not at my fall,

For Iron -- Cold Iron -- is master of men all."


Tears are for the craven, prayers are for the clown --

Halters for the silly neck that cannot keep a crown.

"As my loss is grievous, so my hope is small,

For Iron -- Cold Iron -- must be master of men all!"


Yet his King made answer (few such Kings there be!)

"Here is Bread and here is Wine -- sit and sup with me.

Eat and drink in Mary's Name, the whiles I do recall

How Iron -- Cold Iron -- can be master of men all!"


He took the Wine and blessed it. He blessed and brake the Bread,

With His own Hands He served Them, and presently He said:

"See! These Hands they pierced with nails, outside My city wall,

Show Iron -- Cold Iron -- to be master of men all."


"Wounds are for the desperate, blows are for the strong.

Balm and oil for weary hearts all cut and bruised with wrong.

I forgive thy treason -- I redeem thy fall --

For Iron -- Cold Iron -- must be master of men all!"


Crowns are for the valiant -- sceptres for the bold!

Thrones and powers for mighty men who dare to take and hold.

"Nay!" said the Baron, kneeling in his hall,

"But Iron -- Cold Iron -- is master of men all!

Iron out of Calvary is master of men all!"

Poem 79: Contradictions


The drowsy carrier sways

 To the drowsy horses' tramp.

His axles winnow the sprays

Of the hedge where the rabbit plays

 In the light of his single lamp.


He hears a roar behind,

 A howl, a hoot, and a yell

A headlight strikes him blind

And a stench o'erpowers the wind

 Like a blast from the mouth of Hell.


He mends his swingle-bar

 And loud his curses ring;

But a mother watching afar

Hears the hum of the doctor's car

 Like the beat of an angel's wings!


So, to the poet's mood,

 Motor or carrier's wan,

Properly understood,

Are neither evil nor good--

 Ormuzd not Ahriman!

Poem 80: Cruisers


As our mother the Frigate, bepainted and fine,

Made play for her bully the Ship of the Line;

So we, her bold daughters by iron and fire,

Accost and decoy to our masters' desire.


Now, pray you, consider what toils we endure,

Night-walking wet sea-lanes, a guard and a lure;

Since half of our trade is that same pretty sort

As mettlesome wenches do practise in port.


For this is our office: to spy and make room,

As hiding yet guiding the foe to their doom.

Surrounding, confounding, we bait and betray

And tempt them to battle the seas' width away.


The pot-bellied merchant foreboding no wrong

With headlight and sidelight he lieth along,

Till, lightless and lightfoot and lurking, leap we

To force him discover his business by sea.


And when we have wakened the lust of a foe,

To draw him by flight toward our bullies we go,

Till, 'ware of strange smoke stealing nearer, he flies

Or our bullies close in for to make him good prize.


So, when we have spied on the path of their host,

One flieth to carry that word to the coast;

And, lest by false doublings they turn and go free,

One lieth behind them to follow and see.


Anon we return, being gathered again,

Across the sad valleys all drabbled with rain --

Across the grey ridges all crisped and curled --

To join the long dance round the curve of the world.


The bitter salt spindrift, the sun-glare likewise,

The moon-track a-tremble, bewilders our eyes,

Where, linking and lifting, our sisters we hail

'Twixt wrench of cross-surges or plunge of head-gale.


As maidens awaiting the bride to come forth

Make play with light jestings and wit of no worth,

So, widdershins circling the bride-bed of death,

Each fleereth her neighbour and signeth and saith: --


"What see ye? Their signals, or levin afar?

"What hear ye? God's thunder, or guns of our war?

"What mark ye? Their smoke, or the cloud-rack outblown?

"What chase ye? Their lights, or the Daystar low down?"


So, times past all number deceived by false shows,

Deceiving we cumber the road of our foes,

For this is our virtue: to track and betray;

Preparing great battles a sea's width away.


Now peace is at end and our peoples take heart,

For the laws are clean gone that restrained our art;

Up and down the near headlands and against the far wind

We are loosed (O be swift!) to the work of our kind!

Poem 81: Cuckoo Song


Tell it to the locked-up trees,

Cuckoo, bring your song here!

Warrant, Act and Summons, please,

For Spring to pass along here!

Tell old Winter, if he doubt,

Tell him squat and square -- a!

Old Woman!

Old Woman!

Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out

At Heffle Cuckoo Fair -- a!


March has searched and April tried --

'Tisn't long to Mary now.

Not so far to Whitsuntide

And Cuckoo's come to stay now!

Hear the valiant fellow shout

Down the orchard bare -- a!

Old Woman!

Old Woman!

Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out

At Heffle Cuckoo Fair -- a!


When your heart is young and gay

And the season rules it --

Work your works and play your play

'Fore the Autumn cools it!

Kiss you turn and turn-about,

But my lad, beware -- a!

Old Woman!

Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out

Poem 82: Cupid's Arrows


Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide,

By the hot sun emptied, and blistered and dried;

Log in the plume-grass, hidden and lone;

Bund where the earth-rat's mounds are strown;

Cave in the bank where the sly stream steals;

Aloe that stabs at the belly and heels,

Jump if you dare on a steed untried--

Safer it is to go wide-go wide!

Hark, from in front where the best men ride;--

"Pull to the off, boys! Wide! Go wide!"

Poem 83: Dane-geld


It is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation

 To call upon a neighbour and to say:--

"We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,

 Unless you pay us cash to go away."


And that is called asking for Dane-geld,

 And the people who ask it explain

That you've only to pay 'em the Dane-geld

 And then you'll get rid of the Dane!


It is always a temptation for a reach and lazy nation,

 To puff and look important and to say:--

"Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the

         time to meet you.

 We will therefore pay you cash to go away."


And that is called paying the Dane-geld;

 But we've proved it again and  again,

That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld

 You never get rid of the Dane.


It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,

 For fear they should succumb and go astray;

So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,

 You will find it better policy to say:--


"We never pay any-one Dane-geld,

 No matter how trifling the cost;

For the end of that game is oppression and shame,

 And the nation that plays it is lost!"

Poem 87: Dedication


The Cities are full of pride,

Challenging each to each --

This from her mountain-side,

That from her burthened beach.


They count their ships full tale --

Their corn and oil and wine,

Derrick and loom and bale,

And rampart's gun-flecked line;

City by City they hail:

"Hast aught to match with mine?"


And the men that breed from them

They traffic up and down,

But cling to their cities' hem

As a child to their mother's gown.


When they talk with the stranger bands,

Dazed and newly alone;

When they walk in the stranger lands,

By roaring streets unknown;

Blessing her where she stands

For strength above their own.


(On high to hold her fame

That stands all fame beyond,

By oath to back the same,

Most faithful-foolish-fond;

Making her mere-breathed name

Their bond upon their bond.)


So thank I God my birth

Fell not in isles aside --

Waste headlands of the earth,

Or warring tribes untried --

But that she lent me worth

And gave me right to pride.


Surely in toil or fray

Under an alien sky,

Comfort it is to say:

"Of no mean city am I!"


(Neither by service nor fee

Come I to mine estate --

Mother of Cities to me,

For I was born in her gate,

Between the palms and the sea,

Where the world-end steamers wait.)


Now for this debt I owe,

And for her far-borne cheer

Must I make haste and go

With tribute to her pier.


And she shall touch and remit

After the use of kings

(Orderly, ancient, fit)

My deep-sea plunderings,

And purchase in all lands.

And this we do for a sign

Her power is over mine,

And mine I hold at her hands!

Poem 88: Deep Sea Cables


The wrecks dissolve above us; their dust drops down from afar -

Down to the dark, to the utter dark, where the blind white sea-snakes are.

There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,

Or the great grey level plains of ooze where the shell-burred cables creep.

Here in the womb of the world - here on the tie-ribs of earth

Words, and the words of men, flicker and flutter and beat -

Warning, sorrow and gain, salutation and mirth -

For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.


They have wakened the timeless Things; they have killed their father Time

Joining hands in the gloom, a league from the last of the sun.

Hush! Men talk to-day o'er the waste of the ultimate slime,

And a new Word runs between: whispering, 'Let us be one!'

Poem 89: Delilah


We have another viceroy now, -- those days are dead and done

Of Delilah Aberyswith and depraved Ulysses Gunne.



Delilah Aberyswith was a lady -- not too young --

With a perfect taste in dresses and a badly-bitted tongue,

With a thirst for information, and a greater thirst for praise,

And a little house in Simla in the Prehistoric Days.


By reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power,

Delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour;

And many little secrets, of the half-official kind,

Were whispered to Delilah, and she bore them all in mind.


She patronized extensively a man, Ulysses Gunne,

Whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one.

He wrote for certain papers, which, as everybody knows,

Is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows.


He praised her "queenly beauty" first; and, later on, he hinted

At the "vastness of her intellect" with compliment unstinted.

He went with her a-riding, and his love for her was such

That he lent her all his horses and -- she galled them very much.


One day, THEY brewed a secret of a fine financial sort;

It related to Appointments, to a Man and a Report.

'Twas almost wortth the keeping, -- only seven people knew it --

And Gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently ensue it.


It was a Viceroy's Secret, but -- perhaps the wine was red --

Perhaps an Aged Concillor had lost his aged head --

Perhaps Delilah's eyes were bright -- Delilah's whispers sweet --

The Aged Member told her what 'twere treason to repeat.


Ulysses went a-riding, and they talked of love and flowers;

Ulysses went a-calling, and he called for several hours;

Ulysses went a-waltzing, and Delilah helped him dance --

Ulysses let the waltzes go, and waited for his chance.


The summer sun was setting, and the summer air was still,

The couple went a-walking in the shade of Summer Hill.

The wasteful sunset faded out in turkis-green and gold,

Ulysses pleaded softly, and . . . that bad Delilah told!


Next morn, a startled Empire learnt the all-important news;

Next week, the Aged Councillor was shaking in his shoes.

Next month, I met Delilah and she did not show the least

Hesitation in affirming that Ulysses was a "beast."


                    *


We have another Viceroy now, those days are dead and done --

Off, Delilah Aberyswith and most mean Ulysses Gunne!

Poem 90: Dinah in Heaven


She did not know that she was dead,

 But, when the pang was o'er,

Sat down to wait her Master's tread

 Upon the Golden Floor,


With ears full-cock and anxious eye

 Impatiently resigned;

But ignorant that Paradise

 Did not admit her kind.


Persons with Haloes, Harps, and Wings

 Assembled and reproved;

Or talked to her of Heavenly things,

 But Dinah never moved.


There was one step along the Stair

 That led to Heaven's Gate;

And, till she heard it, her affair

 Was--she explained--to wait.


And she explained with flattened ear,

 Bared lip and milky tooth--

Storming against Ithuriel's Spear

 That only proved her truth!


Sudden--far down the Bridge of Ghosts

 That anxious spirits clomb--

She caught that step in all the hosts,

 And knew that he had come.


She left them wondering what to do,

 But not a doubt had she.

Swifter than her own squeal she flew

 Across the Glassy Sea;


Flushing the Cherubs every where,

 And skidding as she ran,

She refuged under Peter's Chair

 And waited for her man.


.     .     .     .     .     .     .      


There spoke a Spirit out of the press,

 'Said:--"Have you any here

That saved a fool from drunkenness,

 And a coward from his fear?


"That turned a soul from dark to day

 When other help was vain;

That snatched it from Wanhope and made

 A cur a man again?"


"Enter and look," said Peter then,

 And set The Gate ajar.

"If  know aught of women and men

 I trow she is not far."


"Neither by virtue, speech nor art

 Nor hope of grace to win;

But godless innocence of heart

 That never heard of sin:


"Neither by beauty nor belief

 Nor white example shown.

Something a wanton--more a thief--

 But--most of all--mine own."


"Enter and look," said Peter then,

 "And send you well to speed;

But, for all that I know of women and men

 Your riddle is hard to read."


Then flew Dinah from under the Chair,

 Into his arms she flew--

And licked his face from chin to hair

 And Peter passed them through!

Poem 91: Divided Destinies


It was an artless Bandar, and he danced upon a pine,

And much I wondered how he lived, and where the beast might dine,

And many, many other things, till, o'er my morning smoke,

I slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that Bandar spoke.


He said: "O man of many clothes! Sad crawler on the Hills!

Observe, I know not Ranken's shop, nor Ranken's monthly bills;

I take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress;

Nor am I plagued with little cards for little drinks at Mess.


"I steal the bunnia's grain at morn, at noon and eventide,

(For he is fat and I am spare), I roam the mountain side,

I follow no man's carriage, and no, never in my life

Have I flirted at Peliti's with another Bandar's wife.


"O man of futile fopperies -- unnecessary wraps;

I own no ponies in the hills, I drive no tall-wheeled traps;

I buy me not twelve-button gloves, 'short-sixes' eke, or rings,

Nor do I waste at Hamilton's my wealth on 'pretty things.'


"I quarrel with my wife at home, we never fight abroad;

But Mrs. B. has grasped the fact I am her only lord.

I never heard of fever -- dumps nor debts depress my soul;

And I pity and despise you!" Here he pouched my breakfast-roll.


His hide was very mangy, and his face was very red,

And ever and anon he scratched with energy his head.

His manners were not always nice, but how my spirit cried

To be an artless Bandar loose upon the mountain side!


So I answered: "Gentle Bandar, and inscrutable Decree

Makes thee a gleesome fleasome Thou, and me a wretched Me.

Go! Depart in peace, my brother, to thy home amid the pine;

Yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine."

Poem 93: Eddi's Service


Eddi, priest of St. Wilfrid

 In his chapel at Manhood End,

Ordered a midnight service

 For such as cared to attend.


But the Saxons were keeping Christmas,

 And the night was stormy as well.

Nobody came to service,

 Though Eddi rang the bell.


"'Wicked weather for walking,"

 Said Eddi of Manhood End.

"But I must go on with the service

 For such as care to attend."


The altar-lamps were lighted, --

 An old marsh-donkey came,

Bold as a guest invited,

 And stared at the guttering flame.


The storm beat on at the windows,

 The water splashed on the floor,

And a wet, yoke-weary bullock

 Pushed in through the open door.


"How do I know what is greatest,

 How do I know what is least?

That is My Father's business,"

 Said Eddi, Wilfrid's priest.


"But -- three are gathered together --

 Listen to me and attend.

I bring good news, my brethren!"

 Said Eddi of Manhood End.


And he told the Ox of a Manger

 And a Stall in Bethlehem,

And he spoke to the Ass of a Rider,

 That rode to Jerusalem.


They steamed and dripped in the chancel,

 They listened and never stirred,

While, just as though they were Bishops,

 Eddi preached them The World,


Till the gale blew off on the marshes

 And the windows showed the day,

And the Ox and the Ass together

 Wheeled and clattered away.


And when the Saxons mocked him,

 Said Eddi of Manhood End,

"I dare not shut His chapel

 On such as care to attend."

Beneath the summer sun,

She should have passed in cloud and fire

And saved us from this sin

Of war--red war--'twixt child and sire,

Household and kith and kin,

In the heart of a sleepy Midland shire,

With the harvest scarcely in.


But there is no change as we meet at last

On the brow-head or the plain,

And the raw astonished ranks stand fast

To slay or to be slain

By the men they knew in the kindly past

That shall never come again--


By the men they met at dance or chase,

In the tavern or the hall,

At the justice bench and the market place,

At the cudgel play or brawl--

Of their own blood and speech and race,

Comrades or neighbors all!


More bitter than death this day must prove

Whichever way it go,

For the brothers of the maids we love

Make ready to lay low

Their sisters' sweethearts, as we move

Against our dearest foe.

Before our strength gives way.

No matter which they say,

For desolate hearts on the road to En-dor.

  Hands--ah God!--that we knew!

Visions .and voices --look and hark!--

An that those who have passed to the further shore

May' be hailed--at a price--on the road to En-dor.


But they are so deep in their new eclipse

 Nothing they say can reach,

Unless it be uttered by alien lips

 And I framed in a stranger's speech.

The son must send word to the mother that bore,

'Through an hireling's mouth.   'Tis the rule of En-dor.


And not for nothing these gifts are shown

 By such as delight our dead.

They must twitch and stiffen and slaver and groan

 Ere the eyes are set in the head,

And the voice from the belly begins.   Therefore,

We pay them a wage where they ply at En-dor.


Even so, we have need of faith

 And patience to follow the clue.

Often, at first, what the dear one saith

 Is babble, or jest, or untrue.

Till  our  loves--and  their  lives--are  well-known at

Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man.

Flesh of the flesh that I bred, bone of the bone that I bare;

Stark as your sons shall be -- stern as your fathers were.

Deeper than speech our love, stronger than life our tether,

But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together.

My arm is nothing weak, my strength is not gone by;

Sons, I have borne many sons, but my dugs are not dry.

Look, I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors,

That ye may talk together, your Barons and Councillors --

Wards of the Outer March, Lords of the Lower Seas,

Ay, talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees! --

That ye may talk together, brother to brother's face --

Thus for the good of your peoples -- thus for the Pride of the Race.

Also, we will make promise.  So long as The Blood endures,

I shall know that your good is mine:  ye shall feel that my strength is yours:

In the day of Armageddon, at the last great fight of all,

That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall.

Draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands,

And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands.

This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom,

This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom.

The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will,

Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still.

Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you,

After the use of the English, in straight-flung words and few.

Go to your work and be strong, halting not in your ways,

Balking the end half-won for an instant dole of praise.

Stand to your work and be wise -- certain of sword and pen,

Who are neither children nor Gods, but men in a world of men!

Poem 97: Evarra And His Gods


Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea.~

Because the city gave him of her gold,

Because the caravans brought turquoises,

Because his life was sheltered by the King,

So that no man should maim him, none should steal,

Or break his rest with babble in the streets

When he was weary after toil, he made

An image of his God in gold and pearl,

With turquoise diadem and human eyes,

A wonder in the sunshine, known afar,

And worshipped by the King; but, drunk with pride,

Because the city bowed to him for God,

He wrote above the shrine:  "~Thus Gods are made,

And whoso makes them otherwise shall die.~"

And all the city praised him. . . .  Then he died.


~Read here the story of Evarra -- man --

Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea.~

Because the city had no wealth to give,

Because the caravans were spoiled afar,

Because his life was threatened by the King,

So that all men despised him in the streets,

He hewed the living rock, with sweat and tears,

And reared a God against the morning-gold,

A terror in the sunshine, seen afar,

And worshipped by the King; but, drunk with pride,

Because the city fawned to bring him back,

He carved upon the plinth:  "~Thus Gods are made,

And whoso makes them otherwise shall die.~"

And all the people praised him. . . .  Then he died.


~Read here the story of Evarra -- man --

Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea.~

Because he lived among a simple folk,

Because his village was between the hills,

Because he smeared his cheeks with blood of ewes,

He cut an idol from a fallen pine,

Smeared blood upon its cheeks, and wedged a shell

Above its brows for eyes, and gave it hair

Of trailing moss, and plaited straw for crown.

And all the village praised him for this craft,

And brought him butter, honey, milk, and curds.

Wherefore, because the shoutings drove him mad,

He scratched upon that log:  "~Thus Gods are made,

And whoso makes them otherwise shall die.~"

And all the people praised him. . . .  Then he died.


~Read here the story of Evarra -- man --

Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea.~

Because his God decreed one clot of blood

Should swerve one hair's-breadth from the pulse's path,

And chafe his brain, Evarra mowed alone,

Rag-wrapped, among the cattle in the fields,

Counting his fingers, jesting with the trees,

And mocking at the mist, until his God

Drove him to labour.  Out of dung and horns

Dropped in the mire he made a monstrous God,

Abhorrent, shapeless, crowned with plantain tufts,

And when the cattle lowed at twilight-time,

He dreamed it was the clamour of lost crowds,

And howled among the beasts:  "~Thus Gods are made,

And whoso makes them otherwise shall die.~"

Thereat the cattle bellowed. . . .  Then he died.


Yet at the last he came to Paradise,

And found his own four Gods, and that he wrote;

And marvelled, being very near to God,

What oaf on earth had made his toil God's law,

Till God said mocking:  "Mock not.  These be thine."

Then cried Evarra:  "I have sinned!" -- "Not so.

If thou hadst written otherwise, thy Gods

Had rested in the mountain and the mine,

And I were poorer by four wondrous Gods,

And thy more wondrous law, Evarra.  Thine,

Servant of shouting crowds and lowing kine."

Thereat, with laughing mouth, but tear-wet eyes,

Evarra cast his Gods from Paradise.

Some blue deep minion of the Law)--


To range from Ashby-de-la-Zouch

 By Lyonnesse to Locksley Hall,

 Or haply, nearer home, appal

Thy father's sister's staid barouche.

Poem 102: Follow Me 'Ome


There was no one like 'im, 'Orse or Foot,

   Nor any o' the Guns I knew;

An' because it was so, why, o' course 'e went an' died,

   Which is just what the best men do.


    So it's knock out your pipes an' follow me!

    An' it's finish up your swipes an' follow me!

     Oh, 'ark to the big drum callin',

      Follow me -- follow me 'ome!


  'Is mare she neighs the 'ole day long,

   She paws the 'ole night through,

An' she won't take 'er feed 'cause o' waitin' for 'is step,

   Which is just what a beast would do.


  'Is girl she goes with a bombardier

   Before 'er month is through;

An' the banns are up in church, for she's got the beggar hooked,

   Which is just what a girl would do.


  We fought 'bout a dog -- last week it were --

   No more than a round or two;

But I strook 'im cruel 'ard, an' I wish I 'adn't now,

   Which is just what a man can't do.


  'E was all that I 'ad in the way of a friend,

   An' I've 'ad to find one new;

But I'd give my pay an' stripe for to get the beggar back,

   Which it's just too late to do.


    So it's knock out your pipes an' follow me!

    An' it's finish off your swipes an' follow me!

     Oh, 'ark to the fifes a-crawlin'!

      Follow me -- follow me 'ome!


         Take 'im away!  'E's gone where the best men go.

         Take 'im away!  An' the gun-wheels turnin' slow.

         Take 'im away!  There's more from the place 'e come.

         Take 'im away, with the limber an' the drum.


    For it's "Three rounds blank" an' follow me,

    An' it's "Thirteen rank" an' follow me;

     Oh, passin' the love o' women,

      Follow me -- follow me 'ome!

Poem 103: For All We Have And Are


For all we have and are,

For all our children's fate,

Stand up and meet the war.

The Hun is at the gate!

Our world has passed away

In wantonness o'erthrown.

There is nothing left to-day

But steel and fire and stone.


   Though all we knew depart,

   The old commandments stand:

   "In courage keep your heart,

   In strength lift up your hand,"


Once more we hear the word

That sickened earth of old:

"No law except the sword

Unsheathed and uncontrolled,"

Once more it knits mankind.

Once more the nations go

To meet and break and bind

A crazed and driven foe.

Comfort, content, delight--

The ages' slow-bought gain--

They shrivelled in a night,

Only ourselves remain

To face the naked days

In silent fortitude,

Through perils and dismays

Renewed and re-renewed.


   Though all we made depart,

   The old commandments stand:

   "In patience keep your heart,

   In strength lift up your hand."


No easy hopes or lies

Shall bring us to our goal,

But iron sacrifice

Of body, will, and soul

There is but one task for all--

For each one life to give.

Who stands if freedom fall?

Who dies if England live?

Poem 105: For To Admire


The Injian Ocean sets an' smiles

So sof', so bright, so bloomin' blue;

There aren't a wave for miles an' miles

Excep' the jiggle from the screw.

The ship is swep', the day is done,

The bugle's gone for smoke and play;

An' black agin' the settin' sun

The Lascar sings, "~Hum deckty hai!~"                ["I'm looking out."]


    For to admire an' for to see,

      For to be'old this world so wide --

    It never done no good to me,

      But I can't drop it if I tried!


I see the sergeants pitchin' quoits,

I 'ear the women laugh an' talk,

I spy upon the quarter-deck

The orficers an' lydies walk.

I thinks about the things that was,

An' leans an' looks acrost the sea,

Till spite of all the crowded ship

There's no one lef' alive but me.


The things that was which I 'ave seen,

In barrick, camp, an' action too,

I tells them over by myself,

An' sometimes wonders if they're true;

For they was odd -- most awful odd --

But all the same now they are o'er,

There must be 'eaps o' plenty such,

An' if I wait I'll see some more.


Oh, I 'ave come upon the books,

An' frequent broke a barrick rule,

An' stood beside an' watched myself

Be'avin' like a bloomin' fool.

I paid my price for findin' out,

Nor never grutched the price I paid,

But sat in Clink without my boots,

Admirin' 'ow the world was made.


Be'old a crowd upon the beam,

An' 'umped above the sea appears

Old Aden, like a barrick-stove

That no one's lit for years an' years!

I passed by that when I began,

An' I go 'ome the road I came,

A time-expired soldier-man

With six years' service to 'is name.


My girl she said, "Oh, stay with me!"

My mother 'eld me to 'er breast.

They've never written none, an' so

They must 'ave gone with all the rest --

With all the rest which I 'ave seen

An' found an' known an' met along.

I cannot say the things I feel,

And so I sing my evenin' song:


    For to admire an' for to see,

      For to be'old this world so wide --

    It never done no good to me,

      But I can't drop it if I tried!

I have done mostly what most men do,

And pushed it out of my mind;

But I can't forget, if I wanted to,

Four-Feet trotting behind.


Day after day, the whole day through --

Wherever my road inclined --

Four-feet said, "I am coming with you!"

And trotted along behind.

Which I shall never find --

Somewhere that does not carry the sound

Of Four-Feet trotting behind.

Poem 109: Fuzzy-Wuzzy


We've fought with many men acrost the seas,

 An' some of 'em was brave an' some was not:

The Paythan an' the Zulu an' Burmese;

 But the Fuzzy was the finest o' the lot.

We never got a ha'porth's change of 'im:

 'E squatted in the scrub an' 'ocked our 'orses,

'E cut our sentries up at Sua~kim~,

 An' 'e played the cat an' banjo with our forces.

   So 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your 'ome in the Soudan;

   You're a pore benighted 'eathen but a first-class fightin' man;

   We gives you your certificate, an' if you want it signed

   We'll come an' 'ave a romp with you whenever you're inclined.


We took our chanst among the Khyber 'ills,

 The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,

The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills,

 An' a Zulu ~impi~ dished us up in style:

But all we ever got from such as they

 Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller;

We 'eld our bloomin' own, the papers say,

 But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us 'oller.

   Then 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' the missis and the kid;

   Our orders was to break you, an' of course we went an' did.

   We sloshed you with Martinis, an' it wasn't 'ardly fair;

   But for all the odds agin' you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square.


'E 'asn't got no papers of 'is own,

 'E 'asn't got no medals nor rewards,

So we must certify the skill 'e's shown

 In usin' of 'is long two-'anded swords:

When 'e's 'oppin' in an' out among the bush

 With 'is coffin-'eaded shield an' shovel-spear,

An 'appy day with Fuzzy on the rush

 Will last an 'ealthy Tommy for a year.

   So 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' your friends which are no more,

   If we 'adn't lost some messmates we would 'elp you to deplore;

   But give an' take's the gospel, an' we'll call the bargain fair,

   For if you 'ave lost more than us, you crumpled up the square!


'E rushes at the smoke when we let drive,

 An', before we know, 'e's 'ackin' at our 'ead;

'E's all 'ot sand an' ginger when alive,

 An' 'e's generally shammin' when 'e's dead.

'E's a daisy, 'e's a ducky, 'e's a lamb!

 'E's a injia-rubber idiot on the spree,

'E's the on'y thing that doesn't give a damn

 For a Regiment o' British Infantree!

   So 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your 'ome in the Soudan;

   You're a pore benighted 'eathen but a first-class fightin' man;

   An' 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, with your 'ayrick 'ead of 'air --

Poem 110: Gallio's Song


All day long to the judgment-seat

The crazed Provincials drew--

All day long at their ruler's feet

Howled for the blood of the Jew.

Insurrection with one accord

Banded itself and woke,

And Paul was about to open his mouth

When Achaia's Deputy spoke--


"Whether the God descend from above

Or the Man ascend upon high,

Whether this maker of tents be Jove

Or a younger deity--

I will be no judge between your gods

And your godless bickerings.

Lictor, drive them hence with rods--

I care for none of these things!


Were it a question of lawful due

Or Caesar's rule denied,

Reason would I should bear with you

And order it well to be tried;

But this is a question of words and names,

I know the strife it brings.

I will not pass upon any your claims.

I care for none of these things.


One thing only I see most clear,

As I pray you also see.

Claudius Caesar hath set me here

Rome's Deputy to be.

It is Her peace that ye go to break--

Not mine, nor any king's.

But, touching your clamour of 'Conscience sake,'

I care for none of these things.


Whether ye rise for the sake of a creed,

Or riot in hope of spoil,

Equally will I punish the deed,

Equally check the broil;

Nowise permitting injustice at all

From whatever doctrine it springs--

But--whether ye follow Priapus or Paul,

I care for none of these things!"

Poem 111: Gehazi


Whence comest thou, Gehazi,

 So reverend to behold,

In scarlet and in ermines

 And chain of England's gold?"


"From following after Naaman

 To tell him all is well,

Whereby my zeal hath made me

 A Judge in Israel."


Well done; well done, Gehazi!

 Stretch forth thy ready hand,

Thou barely 'scaped from judgment,

 Take oath to judge the land

Unswayed by gift of money

 Or privy bribe, more base,

Of knowledge which is profit

 In any market-place.


Search out and probe, Gehazi,

 As thou of all carist try,

The truthful, well-weighed answer

 That tells the blacker lie --

The loud, uneasy virtue

 The anger feigned at will,

To overbear a witness

 And make the Court keep still.


Take order now, Gehazi,

 That no man talk aside

In secret with his judges

 The while his case is tried.

Lest he should show them -- reason

 To keep a matter hid,

And subtly lead the questions

 Away from what he did.


Thou mirror of uprightness,

 What ails thee at thy vows?

What means the risen whiteness

 Of the skin between thy brows?


The boils that shine and burrow,

 The sores that slough and bleed --

The leprosy of Naaman

 On thee and all thy seed?

   Stand up, stand up, Gehazi,

     Draw close thy robe and go,

   Gehazi, Judge in Israel,

     A leper white as snow!

To a lost cause, and knew the gift was vain.


Later shall rise a people, sane and great,

Forged in strong fires, by equal war made one;

Telling old battles over without hate --

Not least his name shall pass from sire to son.

In the doomed city when we close the score;

Yet o'er his grave -- his grave that holds a man --

Our deep-tongued guns shall answer his once more!

Poem 113: Gentleman-Rankers


To the legion of the lost ones, to the cohort of the damned,

To my brethren in their sorrow overseas,

Sings a gentleman of England cleanly bred, machinely crammed,

And a trooper of the Empress, if you please.

Yea, a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses,

And faith he went the pace and went it blind,

And the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin,

But to-day the Sergeant's something less than kind.

   We're poor little lambs who've lost our way,

      Baa!  Baa!  Baa!

   We're little black sheep who've gone astray,

      Baa--aa--aa!

   Gentlemen-rankers out on the spree,

   Damned from here to Eternity,

   God ha' mercy on such as we,

      Baa!  Yah!  Bah!


Oh, it's sweet to sweat through stables, sweet to empty kitchen slops,

And it's sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell,

To dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops

And thrash the cad who says you waltz too well.

Yes, it makes you cock-a-hoop to be "Rider" to your troop,

And branded with a blasted worsted spur,

When you envy, O how keenly, one poor Tommy being cleanly

Who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you "Sir".


If the home we never write to, and the oaths we never keep,

And all we know most distant and most dear,

Across the snoring barrack-room return to break our sleep,

Can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer?

When the drunken comrade mutters and the great guard-lantern gutters

And the horror of our fall is written plain,

Every secret, self-revealing on the aching white-washed ceiling,

Do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain?


We have done with Hope and Honour, we are lost to Love and Truth,

We are dropping down the ladder rung by rung,

And the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth.

God help us, for we knew the worst too young!

Our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence,

Our pride it is to know no spur of pride,

And the Curse of Reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us

And we die, and none can tell Them where we died.

   We're poor little lambs who've lost our way,

      Baa!  Baa!  Baa!

   We're little black sheep who've gone astray,

      Baa--aa--aa!

   Damned from here to Eternity,

Poem 116: Giffen's Debt


Imprimis he was "broke." Thereafter left

His Regiment and, later, took to drink;

Then, having lost the balance of his friends,

"Went Fantee" -- joined the people of the land,

Turned three parts Mussulman and one Hindu,

And lived among the Gauri villagers,

Who gave him shelter and a wife or twain.

And boasted that a thorough, full-blood sahib

Had come among them. Thus he spent his time,

Deeply indebted to the village shroff

(Who never asked for payment), always drunk,

Unclean, abominable, out-at-heels;

Forgetting that he was an Englishman.


You know they dammed the Gauri with a dam,

And all the good contractors scamped their work

And all the bad material at hand

Was used to dam the Gauri -- which was cheap,

And, therefore, proper. Then the Gauri burst,

And several hundred thousand cubic tons

Of water dropped into the valley, flop,

And drowned some five-and-twenty villagers,

And did a lakh or two of detriment

To crops and cattle. When the flood went down

We found him dead, beneath an old dead horse,

Full six miles down the valley. So we said

He was a victim to the Demon Drink,

And moralised upon him for a week,

And then forgot him. Which was natural.


But, in the valley of the Gauri, men

Beneath the shadow of the big new dam,

Relate a foolish legend of the flood,

Accounting for the little loss of life

(Only those five-and-twenty villagers)

In this wise: -- On the evening of the flood,

They heard the groaning of the rotten dam,

And voices of the Mountain Devils. Then

And incarnation of the local God,

Mounted upon a monster-neighing horse,

And flourishing a flail-like whip, came down,

Breathing ambrosia, to the villages,

And fell upon the simple villagers

With yells beyond the power of mortal throat,

And blows beyond the power of mortal hand,

And smote them with his flail-like whip, and drove

Them clamorous with terror up the hill,

And scattered, with the monster-neighing steed,

Their crazy cottages about their ears,

And generally cleared those villages.

Then came the water, and the local God,

Breathing ambrosia, flourishing his whip,

And mounted on his monster-neighing steed,

Went down the valley with the flying trees

And residue of homesteads, while they watched

Safe on the mountain-side these wondrous things,

And knew that they were much beloved of Heaven.


Wherefore, and when the dam was newly built,

They raised a temple to the local God,

And burnt all manner of unsavoury things

Upon his altar, and created priests,

And blew into a conch and banged a bell,

And told the story of the Gauri flood

With circumstance and much embroidery. . . .

So hi, the whiskified Objectionable,

Unclean, abominable, out-at-heels,

Became the tutelary Deity

Of all the Gauri valley villages,

And may in time become a Solar Myth.

Poem 117: Gipsy Vans


Unless you come of the Gypsy stock

 That steals by night and day,

Lock your heart with a double lock

 And throw the key away.

Bury it under the blackest stone

 Beneath your father's hearth,

And keep your eyes on your lawful own

 And your feet to the proper path.

   Then you can stand at your door and mock

      When the Gypsy vans come through...

    For it isn't right that the Giorgio stock

      Should live as the Romany do.


Unless you come of the Gypsy blood

 That takes and never spares,

Bide content with your given good

 And follow your own affairs.

Plough and harrow and roll your land,

 And sow what ought to be sowed;

But never let loose your heart from your hand,

 Nor flitter it down the road!

   Then you can thrive on your boughten food

     As the Gypsy vans come through...

   For it isn't nature the Giorgio blood

     Should love as the Romany do.


Unless you carry the Gypsy eyes

 That see but seldom weep,

Keep your head from the naked skies

 Or the stars'll trouble your sleep.

Watch your moon through your window-pane

 And take what weather she brews;

But don't run out in the midnight rain

 Nor home in the morning dews.

   Then you can buddle and shut your eyes

     As the Gypsy vans come through...

   For it isn't fitting the Giorgio ryes

     Should walk as the Romany do.


Unless you come of the Gypsy race

 That counts all time the same,

Be you careful of Time and Place

 And Judgment and Good Name:

Lose your life for to live your life

 The way that you ought to do;

And when you are finished, your God and your wife

 And the Gipsies'll laugh at you!

       Then you can rot in your burying place

           As the Gypsy vans come through...

        For it isn't reason the Giorgio race

          Should die as the Romany do.

        How shall we fall?


       *


This I saw when the rites were done,

          And the lamps were dead and the Gods alone,

          And the grey snake coiled on the altar stone--

          Ere I fled from a Fear that I could not see,

          And the Gods of the East made mouths at me.

Poem 119: Great-Heart


Concerning brave Captains

  Our age hath made known

For all men to honour,

  One standeth alone,

Of whom, o'er both oceans,

  Both peoples may say:

"Our realm is diminished

  With Great-Heart away."


In purpose unsparing,

  In action no less,

The labours he praised

 He would seek and profess

Through travail and battle,

  At hazard and pain.  .  .  .

And our world is none the braver

 Since Great-Heart was ta'en!


Plain speech with plain folk,

 And plain words for false things,

Plain faith in plain dealing

 'Twixt neighbours or kings,

He used and he followed,

 However it sped.  .  .  .

Oh,  our  world  is  none  more  honest

 Now Great-Heart is dead!


The heat of his spirit

 Struck warm through all lands;

For he loved such as showed

 'Emselves men of their hands;

In love, as in hate,

 Paying home to the last.  .  .  .

But our world is none the kinder

 Now Great-Heart hath passed!


Hard-schooled by long power,

 Yet most humble of mind

Where aught that he was

 Might advantage mankind.

Leal servant, loved master,

 Rare comrade, sure guide.  .  .  .

Oh, our world is none the safer

 Now Great-Heart hath died!


Let those who would handle

 Make sure they can wield

His far-reaching sword

 And his close-guarding shield:

For those who must journey

 Henceforward alone

Have need of stout convoy

 Now Great-Heart is gone.

Poem 120: Gunga Din


You may talk o' gin and beer

When you're quartered safe out 'ere,

An' you're sent to penny-fights an' Aldershot it;

But when it comes to slaughter

You will do your work on water,

An' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it.

Now in Injia's sunny clime,

Where I used to spend my time

A-servin' of 'Er Majesty the Queen,

Of all them blackfaced crew

The finest man I knew

Was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din.

      He was "Din! Din! Din!

  You limpin' lump o' brick-dust, Gunga Din!

      Hi! slippery ~hitherao~!

      Water, get it!  ~Panee lao~!                  [Bring water swiftly.]

  You squidgy-nosed old idol, Gunga Din."


The uniform 'e wore

Was nothin' much before,

An' rather less than 'arf o' that be'ind,

For a piece o' twisty rag

An' a goatskin water-bag

Was all the field-equipment 'e could find.

When the sweatin' troop-train lay

In a sidin' through the day,

Where the 'eat would make your bloomin' eyebrows crawl,

We shouted "Harry By!"          [Mr. Atkins's equivalent for "O brother."]

Till our throats were bricky-dry,

Then we wopped 'im 'cause 'e couldn't serve us all.

      It was "Din! Din! Din!

  You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?

      You put some ~juldee~ in it                              [Be quick.]

      Or I'll ~marrow~ you this minute                          [Hit you.]

  If you don't fill up my helmet, Gunga Din!"


'E would dot an' carry one

Till the longest day was done;

An' 'e didn't seem to know the use o' fear.

If we charged or broke or cut,

You could bet your bloomin' nut,

'E'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear.

With 'is ~mussick~ on 'is back,                              [Water-skin.]

'E would skip with our attack,

An' watch us till the bugles made "Retire",

An' for all 'is dirty 'ide

'E was white, clear white, inside

When 'e went to tend the wounded under fire!

      It was "Din! Din! Din!"

  With the bullets kickin' dust-spots on the green.

      When the cartridges ran out,

      You could hear the front-files shout,

  "Hi! ammunition-mules an' Gunga Din!"


I shan't forgit the night

When I dropped be'ind the fight

With a bullet where my belt-plate should 'a' been.

I was chokin' mad with thirst,

An' the man that spied me first

Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din.

'E lifted up my 'ead,

An' he plugged me where I bled,

An' 'e guv me 'arf-a-pint o' water-green:

It was crawlin' and it stunk,

But of all the drinks I've drunk,

I'm gratefullest to one from Gunga Din.

      It was "Din! Din! Din!

  'Ere's a beggar with a bullet through 'is spleen;

      'E's chawin' up the ground,

      An' 'e's kickin' all around:

  For Gawd's sake git the water, Gunga Din!"


'E carried me away

To where a dooli lay,

An' a bullet come an' drilled the beggar clean.

'E put me safe inside,

An' just before 'e died,

"I 'ope you liked your drink", sez Gunga Din.

So I'll meet 'im later on

At the place where 'e is gone --

Where it's always double drill and no canteen;

'E'll be squattin' on the coals

Givin' drink to poor damned souls,

An' I'll get a swig in hell from Gunga Din!

      Yes, Din! Din! Din!

  You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!

      Though I've belted you and flayed you,

      By the livin' Gawd that made you,

  You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!

Poem 121: Hadramauti


Who knows the heart of the Christian? How does he reason?

What are his measures and balances? Which is his season

For laughter, forbearance or bloodshed, and what devils move him

When he arises to smite us? I do not love him.

He invites the derision of strangers—he enters all places.

Booted, bareheaded he enters. With shouts and embraces

He asks of us news of the household whom we reckon nameless.

Certainly Allah created him forty-fold shameless!


So it is not in the Desert. One came to me weeping—

The Avenger of Blood on his track—I took him in keeping.

Demanding not whom he had slain, I refreshed him, I fed him

As he were even a brother. But Eblis had bred him.


He was the son of an ape, ill at ease in his clothing.

He talked with his head, hands and feet. I endured him with loathing.

Whatever his spirit conceived his countenance showed it

As a frog shows in a mud-puddle. Yet I abode it!


I fingered my beard and was dumb, in silence confronting him.

His soul was too shallow for silence, e'en with Death hunting him.

I said: "'Tis his weariness speaks," but, when he had rested,

He chirped in my face like some sparrow, and, presently, jested!


Wherefore slew I that stranger? He brought me dishonour.

I saddled my mare, Bijli, I set him upon her.

I gave him rice and goat's flesh. He bared me to laughter.

When he was gone from my tent, swift I followed after,

Taking my sword in my hand. The hot wine had filled him.

Under the stars he mocked me—therefore I killed him!

Poem 122: Half-Ballad of Waterval


When by the labor of my 'ands

  I've 'elped to pack a transport tight

With prisoners for foreign lands,    

 I ain't transported with delight.

 I know it's only just an' right,

   But yet it somehow sickens me,

For I 'ave learned at Waterval

   The meanin' of captivity.


Be'ind the pegged barb-wire strands,

 Beneath the tall electric light,

We used to walk in bare-'ead bands,

 Explainin' 'ow we lost our fight;

 An' that is what they'll do to-night

   Upon the steamer out at sea,

If  I 'ave learned at Waterval

   The meanin' of captivity.


They'll never know the shame that brands--

 Black shame no livin' down makes white--

The mockin' from the sentry-stands,

 The women's laugh, the gaoler's spite.

 We are too bloomin'-much polite,

    But that is 'ow I'd 'ave us be   .   .   .

Since I 'ave learned at Waterval

   The meanin' of captivity.


They'll get those draggin' days all right,

 Spent as a foreigner commands,

An' 'orrors of the locked-up night,

 With 'Ell's own thinkin' on their 'ands.

 I'd give the gold o' twenty Rands

    (If it was mine) to set 'em free

 For I 'ave learned at Waterval

Poem 123: Harp Song of the Dane Women


What is a woman that you forsake her,

And the hearth-fire and the home-acre.

To go with the old grey Widow-maker?


She has no house to lay a guest in

But one chill bed for all to rest in,

That the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in.


She has no strong white arms to fold you,

But the ten-times-fingering weed to hold you

Out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you.


Yet, when the signs of summer thicken,

And the ice breaks, and the birch-buds quicken,

Yearly you turn from our side, and sicken- -


Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters.

You steal away to the lapping waters,

And look at your ship in her winter-quarters.


You forget our mirth, and talk at the tables,

The kine in the shed and the horse in the stables

To pitch her sides and go over her cables.


Then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow,

And the sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow,

Is all we have left through the months to follow.


Ah, what is Woman that you forsake her,

And the hearth-fire and the home-acre,

To go with the old grey Widow-maker?

Poem 124: Helen All Alone


There was darkness under Heaven

       For an hour's space--

     Darkness that we knew was given

       Us for special grace.

     Sun and noon and stars were hid,

       God had left His Throne,

     When Helen came to me, she did,

       Helen all alone!


     Side by side (because our fate

       Damned us ere our birth)

     We stole out of Limbo Gate

       Looking for the Earth.

     Hand in pulling hand amid

       Fear no dreams have known,

     Helen ran with me, she did,

       Helen all alone!


     When the Horror passing speech

       Hunted us along,

     Each laid hold on each, and each

       Found the other strong.

     In the teeth of Things forbid

       And Reason overthrown,

     Helen stood by me, she did,

       Helen all alone!


     When, at last, we heard those Fires

       Dull and die away,

     When, at last, our linked desires

       Dragged us up to day;

     When, at last, our souls were rid

       Of what that Night had shown,

     Helen passed from me, she did,

       Helen all alone!


     Let her go and find a mate,

       As I will find a bride,

     Knowing naught of Limbo Gate

       Or Who are penned inside.

     There is knowledge God forbid

       More than one should own.

     So Helen went from me, she did,

       Oh, my soul, be glad she did!

     Helen all alone!

"Then mend the horses' laggard pace!"

You had no mind to face our swords,

And--where can cowards run, my lord?

Poem 129: How the Camel Got His Hump


The Camel's hump is an ugly lump

        Which well you may see at the Zoo;

      But uglier yet is the hump we get

        From having too little to do.


      Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,

      If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,

            We get the hump--

            Cameelious hump--

      The hump that is black and blue!


      We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,

        And a snarly-yarly voice.

      We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl

        At our bath and our boots and our toys;


      And there ought to be a corner for me

      (And I know' there is one for you)

            When we get the hump--

            Cameelious hump--

      The hump that is black and blue!


      The cure for this ill is not to sit still,

        Or frowst with a book by the fire;

      But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,

        And dig  till you gently perspire;


      And then you will find that the sun and the wind,

      And the Djinn of the Garden too,

        Have lifted the hump--

As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled

        Once, twice, and again!

And a doe leaped up -- and a doe leaped up

From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.

This I, scouting alone, beheld,

        Once, twice, and again!


As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled

        Once, twice, and again!

And a wolf stole back -- and a wolf stole back

To carry the word to the waiting Pack;

And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track

        Once, twice, and again!


As the dawn was breaking the Wolf-pack yelled

        Once, twice, and again!

Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!

Eyes that can see in the dark -- the dark!

Tongue -- give tongue to it! Hark! O Hark!

        Once, twice, and again!


His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo's pride --

Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide.


If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore;

Ye need not stop work to inform us; we knew it ten seasons before.


Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother,

For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.


"There is none like to me!" says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;

But the Jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still.

The seas are dark with wrath,

The Nations in their harness

Go up against our path:

Ere yet we loose the legions --

Ere yet we draw the blade,

Jehovah of the Thunders,

Lord God of Battles, aid!


High lust and froward bearing,

Proud heart, rebellious brow --

Deaf ear and soul uncaring,

We seek Thy mercy now!

The sinner that forswore Thee,

The fool that passed Thee by,

Our times are known before Thee --

Lord, grant us strength to die!


For those who kneel beside us

At altars not Thine own,

Who lack the lights that guide us,

Lord, let their faith atone.

If wrong we did to call them,

By honour bound they came;

Let not Thy Wrath befall them,

But deal to us the blame.


From panic, pride, and terror,

Revenge that knows no rein,

Light haste and lawless error,

Protect us yet again.

Cloak Thou our undeserving,

Make firm the shuddering breath,

In silence and unswerving

To taste Thy lesser death!


Ah, Mary pierced with sorrow,

Remember, reach and save

The soul that comes to-morrow

Before the God that gave!

Since each was born of woman,

For each at utter need --

True comrade and true foeman --

Madonna, intercede!


E'en now their vanguard gathers,

E'en now we face the fray --

As Thou didst help our fathers,

Help Thou our host to-day!

Fulfilled of signs and wonders,

In life, in death made clear --

 I send them east and west;

But after they have worked for me,

 I give them all a rest.


I let them rest from nine till five,

 For I am busy then,

As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,

 For they are hungry men.

But different folk have different views;

 I know a person small-

She keeps ten million serving-men,

 Who get no rest at all!


She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,

 From the second she opens her eyes-

One million Hows, two million Wheres,

  And seven million Whys!

Poem 136: If


If you can keep your head when all about you

 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

 But make allowance for their doubting too:

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

 Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,

Or being hated don't give way to hating,

 And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;


If you can dream---and not make dreams your master;

 If you can think---and not make thoughts your aim,

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

 And treat those two impostors just the same:.

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

 And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings,

 And never breathe a word about your loss:

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

 To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

 Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

 Or walk with Kings---nor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

 If all men count with you, but none too much:

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

 With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,

Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

 And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!

My garden blazes brightly with the rose-bush and the peach,

 And the koil sings above it, in the siris by the well,

From the creeper-covered trellis comes the squirrel's chattering speech,

 And the blue jay screams and flutters where the cheery sat-bhai dwell.

But the rose has lost its fragrance, and the koil's note is strange;

 I am sick of endless sunshine, sick of blossom-burdened bough.

Give me back the leafless woodlands where the winds of Springtime range --

 Give me back one day in England, for it's Spring in England now!


Through the pines the gusts are booming, o'er the brown fields blowing chill,

 From the furrow of the ploughshare streams the fragrance of the loam,

And the hawk nests on the cliffside and the jackdaw in the hill,

 And my heart is back in England 'mid the sights and sounds of Home.

But the garland of the sacrifice this wealth of rose and peach is,

 Ah! koil, little koil, singing on the siris bough,

In my ears the knell of exile your ceaseless bell like speech is --

 Can you tell me aught of England or of Spring in England now?

When, foot to wheel and back to wind,

The helmsman dare not look behind,

But hears beyond his compass-light,

The blind bow thunder through the night,

And, like a harpstring ere it snaps,

The rigging sing beneath the caps;

 Above the shriek of storm in sail

   Or rattle of the blocks blown free,

 Set for the peace beyond the gale,

   This song the Needle sings the Sea;


Oh, drunken Wave! Oh, driving Cloud!

 Rage of the Deep and sterile Rain,

By love upheld, by God allowed,

 We go, but we return again!


When leagued about the 'wildered boat

The rainbow Jellies fill and float,

And, lilting where the laver lingers,

The Starfish trips on all her fingers;

Where, 'neath his myriad spines ashock,

The Sea-egg ripples down the rock,

An orange wonder dimly guessed

From darkness where the Cuttles rest,

Moored o'er the darker deeps that hide

The blind white Sea-snake and his bride,

Who, drowsing, nose the long-lost Ships

Let down through darkness to their lips --

Safe-swung above the glassy death,

Hear what the constant Needle saith:


Oh, lisping Reef! Oh, listless Cloud,

 In slumber on a pulseless main!

By Love upheld, by God allowed,

 We go, but we return again!


E'en so through Tropic and through Trade,

 Awed by the shadow of new skies,

As we shall watch old planets fade

 And mark the stranger stars arise,

So, surely, back through Sun and Cloud,

 So, surely, from the outward main

By Love recalled, by God allowed,

 Shall we return -- return again!

 Yea, we return -- return again!

For food and fame and woolly horses' pelt;

And I sang of all we fought and feared and felt.


Yea, I sang as now I sing, when the Prehistoric spring

Made the piled Biscayan ice-pack split and shove;

And the troll and gnome and dwerg, and the Gods of Cliff and Berg

Were about me and beneath me and above.


But a rival, of Solutr]/e, told the tribe my style was ~outr]/e~ --

'Neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell.

And I left my views on Art, barbed and tanged, below the heart

Of a mammothistic etcher at Grenelle.


Then I stripped them, scalp from skull, and my hunting dogs fed full,

And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong;

And I wiped my mouth and said, "It is well that they are dead,

For I know my work is right and theirs was wrong."


But my Totem saw the shame; from his ridgepole shrine he came,

And he told me in a vision of the night: --

"There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,

And every single one of them is right!"


    .    .    .    .    .


Then the silence closed upon me till They put new clothing on me

Of whiter, weaker flesh and bone more frail;

And I stepped beneath Time's finger, once again a tribal singer

[And a minor poet certified by Tr--ll].


Still they skirmish to and fro, men my messmates on the snow,

When we headed off the aurochs turn for turn;

When the rich Allobrogenses never kept amanuenses,

And our only plots were piled in lakes at Berne.


Still a cultured Christian age sees us scuffle, squeak, and rage,

Still we pinch and slap and jabber, scratch and dirk;

Still we let our business slide -- as we dropped the half-dressed hide --

To show a fellow-savage how to work.


Still the world is wondrous large, -- seven seas from marge to marge, --

And it holds a vast of various kinds of man;

And the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of Khatmandhu,

And the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.


Here's my wisdom for your use, as I learned it when the moose

And the reindeer roared where Paris roars to-night: --

There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,

And -- every -- single -- one -- of -- them -- is -- right!

Poem 142: James I


The child of Mary Queen of Scots,

 A shifty mother's shiftless son,

Bred up among intrigues and plots,

 Learned in all things, wise in none.

Ungainly, babbling, wasteful, weak,

 Shrewd, clever, cowardly, pedantic,

The sight of steel would blanch his cheek,

 The smell of baccy drive him frantic.

He was the author of his line--

 He wrote that witches should be burnt;

He wrote that monarchs were divine,

 And left a son who--proved they weren't!

Poem 143: Jane's Marriage


Jane went to Paradise:

 That was only fair.

Good Sir Walter followed her,

 And armed her up the stair.

Henry and Tobias,

 And Miguel of Spain,

Stood with Shakespeare at the top

 To welcome Jane--


Then the Three Archangels

 Offered out of hand

Anything in Heaven's gift

 That she might command.

Azrael's eyes upon her,

 Raphael's wings above,

Michael's sword against her heart,

 Jane said: "Love."


Instantly the under-

 Standing Seraphim

Laid their fingers on their lips

 And went to look for him.

Stole across the Zodiac,

    Harnessed Charles's Wain,

 And whispered round the Nebulae

    "Who loved Jane?"


In a private limbo

 Where none had thought to look,

Sat a Hampshire gentleman

 Reading of a book.

It was called Persuasion

 And it told the plain

Story of the love between

 Him and Jane.


He heard the question,

 Circle Heaven through--

Closed the book and answered:

 "I did -- and do!"

Quietly but speedily

 (As Captain Wentworth moved)

Entered into Paradise

 The man Jane loved!


Jane lies in Winchester, blessed be her shade!

Praise the Lord for making her, and her for all she made.

And while the stones of Winchester--or Milson Street--remain,

Glory, Love, and Honour unto England's Jane!

Poem 144: Jubal and Tubal Cain


Jubal sang of the Wrath of God

   And the curse of thistle and thorn--

But Tubal got him a pointed rod,

   And scrabbled the earth for corn.

   Old--old as that early mould,

        Young as the sprouting grain--      

   Yearly green is the strife between

        Jubal and Tubal Cain!


Jubal sang of the new-found sea,

  And the love that its waves divide--

But Tubal hollowed a fallen tree

   And passed to the further side.

   Black-black as the hurricane-wrack,

       Salt as the under-main-

   Bitter and cold is the hate they hold--

   Jubal and Tubal Cain!


Jubal sang of the golden years

   Uhen wars and wounds shall cease--

But Tubal fashioned the hand-flung spears

    And showed his neighbours peace

    New--new as Nine-point-Two

         Older than Lamech's slain--

    Roaring and loud is the feud avowed

         Twix'' Jubal and Tubal Cain!


Jubal sang of the cliffs that bar

   And the peaks that none may crown--

But Tubal clambered by jut and scar

   And there he builded a town.

   High-high as the snowsheds lie,

        Low as the culverts drain--

   Wherever they be they can never agree--

         Jubal and Tubal Cain!

Poem 145: Justice


Across a world where all men grieve

 And grieving strive the more,

The great days range like tides and leave

 Our dead on every shore.

Heavy the load we undergo,

 And our own hands prepare,

If we have parley with the foe,

 The load our sons must bear.


Before we loose the word

 That bids new worlds to birth,

Needs must we loosen first the sword

 Of Justice upon earth;

Or else all else is vain

 Since life on earth began,

And the spent world sinks back again

 Hopeless of God and Man.


A People and their King

 Through ancient sin grown strong,

Because they feared no reckoning

 Would set no bound to wrong;

But now their hour is past,

 And we who bore it find

Evil Incarnate hell at last

 To answer to mankind.


For agony and spoil

 Of nations beat to dust,

For poisoned air and tortured soil

 And cold, commanded lust,

And every secret woe

 The shuddering waters saw.

Willed and fulfilled by high and low.

 Let them relearn the Low.


That when the dooms are read,

 Not high nor low shall say:--

" My haughty or my humble head

 Was saved me in this day."

That, till the end of time,

 Their remnant shall recall

Their fathers old, confederate crime

 Availed them not at all.


That neither schools nor priests,

 Nor Kings may build again

A people with the heart of beasts

 Made wise concerning men.

Whereby our dead shall sleep

 In honour, unbetrayed,

And we in faith and honour keep

 That peace for which they paid.

Poem 147: Kitchener's School


Oh Hubshee, carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast!

This is the message of Kitchener who did not break you in jest.

It was permitted to him to fulfil the long-appointed years;

Reaching the end ordained of old over your dead Emirs.


He stamped only before your walls, and the Tomb ye knew was dust:

He gathered up under his armpits all the swords of your trust:

He set a guard on your granaries, securing the weak from the strong:

He said: -- "Go work the waterwheels that were abolished so long."


He said: -- "Go safely, being abased. I have accomplished my vow."

That was the mercy of Kitchener. Cometh his madness now!

He does not desire as ye desire, nor devise as ye devise:

He is preparing a second host -- an army to make you wise.


Not at the mouth of his clean-lipped guns shall ye learn his name again,

But letter by letter, from Kaf to Kaf, at the mouths of his chosen men.

He has gone back to his own city, not seeking presents or bribes,

But openly asking the English for money to buy you Hakims and scribes.


Knowing that ye are forfeit by battle and have no right to live,

He begs for money to bring you learning -- and all the English give.

It is their treasure -- it is their pleasure -- thus are their hearts inclined:

For Allah created the English mad -- the maddest of all mankind!


They do not consider the Meaning ofThings; they consult not creed nor clan.

Behold, they clap the slave on the back, and behold, he ariseth a man!

They terribly carpet the earth with dead, and before their cannon cool,

They walk unarmed by twos and threes to call the living to school.


How is this reason (which is their reason) to judge a scholar's worth,

By casting a ball at three straight sticks and defending the same with a fourth?

But this they do (which is doubtless a spell) and other matters more strange,

Until, by the operation of years, the hearts of their scholars change:


Till these make come and go great boats or engines upon the rail

(But always the English watch near by to prop them when they fail);

Till these make laws of their own choice and Judges of their

And all the mad English obey the Judges and say that that Law is good.


Certainly they were mad from of old; but I think one new thing,

That the magic whereby they work their magic -- wherefrom their fortunes spring --

May be that they show all peoples their magic and ask no price in return.

Wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, O Hubshee, make haste and learn!


Certainly also is Kitchener mad. But one sure thing I know --

If he who broke you be minded to teach you, to his Madrissa go!

Go, and carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast,

For he who did not slay you in sport, he will not teach you in jest.

Poem 148: L'envoi


There's a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield,

And the ricks stand gray to the sun,

Singing: -- "Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,

And your English summer's done."

   You have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,

   And the thresh of the deep-sea rain;

   You have heard the song -- how long! how long?

   Pull out on the trail again!


  Ha' done with the Tents of Shem, dear lass,

  We've seen the seasons through,

  And it's time to turn on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

  Pull out, pull out, on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


It's North you may run to the rime-ringed sun,

Or South to the blind Horn's hate;

Or East all the way into Mississippi Bay,

Or West to the Golden Gate;

   Where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,

   And the wildest tales are true,

   And the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

   And life runs large on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


The days are sick and cold, and the skies are gray and old,

And the twice-breathed airs blow damp;

And I'd sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll

Of a black Bilbao tramp;

   With her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,

   And a drunken Dago crew,

   And her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail

   From Cadiz Bar on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


There be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,

Or the way of a man with a maid;

But the fairest way to me is a ship's upon the sea

In the heel of the North-East Trade.

   Can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,

   And the drum of the racing screw,

   As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

   As she lifts and 'scends on the Long Trail --

     the trail that is always new?


See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,

And the fenders grind and heave,

And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,

And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;

   It's "Gang-plank up and in," dear lass,

   It's "Hawsers warp her through!"

   And it's "All clear aft" on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

   We're backing down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,

And the sirens hoot their dread!

When foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless viewless deep

To the sob of the questing lead!

   It's down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,

   With the Gunfleet Sands in view,

   Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail,

     our own trail, the out trail,

   And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail --

     the trail that is always new.


O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light

That holds the hot sky tame,

And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors

Where the scared whale flukes in flame!

   Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,

   And her ropes are taut with the dew,

   For we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

   We're sagging south on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,

And the shouting seas drive by,

And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,

And the Southern Cross rides high!

   Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,

   That blaze in the velvet blue.

   They're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

   They're God's own guides on the Long Trail --

     the trail that is always new.


Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start --

We're steaming all-too slow,

And it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle

Where the trumpet-orchids blow!

   You have heard the call of the off-shore wind,

   And the voice of the deep-sea rain;

   You have heard the song -- how long! how long?

   Pull out on the trail again!


  The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,

  And The Deuce knows what we may do --

  But we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

  We're down, hull down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.

Poem 149: L'Envoi to Life's Handicap


My new-cut ashlar takes the light

Where crimson-blank the windows flare;

By my own work, before the night,

Great Overseer I make my prayer.


If there be good in that I wrought,

Thy hand compelled it, Master, Thine;

Where I have failed to meet Thy thought

I know, through Thee, the blame is mine.


One instant's toil to Thee denied

Stands all Eternity's offence,

Of that I did with Thee to guide

To Thee, through Thee, be excellence.


Who, lest all thought of Eden fade,

Bring'st Eden to the craftsman's brain,

Godlike to muse o'er his own trade

And Manlike stand with God again.


The depth and dream of my desire,

The bitter paths wherein I stray,

Thou knowest Who hast made the Fire,

Thou knowest Who hast made the Clay!


One stone the more swings to her place

In that dread Temple of Thy Worth --

It is enough that through Thy grace

I saw naught common on Thy earth.


Take not that vision from my ken;

Oh whatsoe'er may spoil or speed,

Help me to need no aid from men

That I may help such men as need!

Poem 150: La Nuit Blanche


A much-discerning Public hold

   The Singer generally sings

 And prints and sells his past for gold.


 Whatever I may here disclaim,

   The very clever folk I sing to

   Will most indubitably cling to

 Their pet delusion, just the same.



I had seen, as the dawn was breaking

 And I staggered to my rest,

Tari Devi softly shaking

 From the Cart Road to the crest.

I had seen the spurs of Jakko

 Heave and quiver, swell and sink.

Was it Earthquake or tobacco,

 Day of Doom, or Night of Drink?


In the full, fresh fragrant morning

 I observed a camel crawl,

Laws of gravitation scorning,

 On the ceiling and the wall;

Then I watched a fender walking,

 And I heard grey leeches sing,

And a red-hot monkey talking

 Did not seem the proper thing.


Then a Creature, skinned and crimson,

 Ran about the floor and cried,

And they said that I had the "jims" on,

 And they dosed me with bromide,

And they locked me in my bedroom --

 Me and one wee Blood Red Mouse --

Though I said: "To give my head room

 You had best unroof the house."


But my words were all unheeded,

 Though I told the grave M.D.

That the treatment really needed

 Was a dip in open sea

That was lapping just below me,

 Smooth as silver, white as snow,

And it took three men to throw me

 When I found I could not go.


Half the night I watched the Heavens

 Fizz like '81 champagne --

Fly to sixes and to sevens,

 Wheel and thunder back again;

And when all was peace and order

 Save one planet nailed askew,

Much I wept because my warder

 Would not let me sit it true.


After frenzied hours of wating,

 When the Earth and Skies were dumb,

Pealed an awful voice dictating

 An interminable sum,

Changing to a tangle story --

 "What she said you said I said" --

Till the Moon arose in glory,

 And I found her . . . in my head;


Then a Face came, blind and weeping,

 And It couldn't wipe its eyes,

And It muttered I was keeping

 Back the moonlight from the skies;

So I patted it for pity,

 But it whistled shrill with wrath,

And a huge black Devil City

 Poured its peoples on my path.


So I fled with steps uncertain

 On a thousand-year long race,

But the bellying of the curtain

 Kept me always in one place;

While the tumult rose and maddened

 To the roar of Earth on fire,

Ere it ebbed and sank and saddened

 To a whisper tense as wire.


In tolerable stillness

 Rose one little, little star,

And it chuckled at my illness,

 And it mocked me from afar;

And its breathren came and eyed me,

 Called the Universe to aid,

Till I lay, with naught to hide me,

 'Neath' the Scorn of All Things Made.


Dun and saffron, robed and splendid,

 Broke the solemn, pitying Day,

And I knew my pains were ended,

 And I turned and tried to pray;

But my speech was shattered wholly,

 And I wept as children weep.

Till the dawn-wind, softly, slowly,

 Brought to burning eyelids sleep.

Poem 151: Lady Geraldine's Hardship


I turned -- Heaven knows we women turn too much

To broken reeds, mistaken so for pine

That shame forbids confession -- a handle I turned

(The wrong one, said the agent afterwards)

And so flung clean across your English street

Through the shrill-tinkling glass of the shop-front-paused,

Artemis mazed 'mid gauds to catch a man,

And piteous baby-caps and christening-gowns,

The worse for being worn on the radiator.


My cousin Romney judged me from the bench:

Propounding one sleek forty-shillinged law

That takes no count of the Woman's oversoul.

I should have entered, purred he, by the door --

The man's retort -- the open obvious door --

And since I chose not, he -- not he -- could change

The man's rule, not the Woman's, for the case.

Ten pounds or seven days... Just that... I paid!

Poem 152: Late Came the God


Late came the God, having sent his forerunners who were

     not regarded--

 Late, but in wrath;

Saying: "The wrong shall be paid, the contempt be rewarded

 On all that she hath."

He poisoned the blade and struck home, the full bosom receiving

The wound and the venom in one, past cure or relieving.

He made treaty with Time to stand still that the grief might

    be fresh--

Daily renewed and nightly pursued through her soul to her

    flesh--

Mornings of memory, noontides of agony, midnights unslaked

    for her,

Till the stones of the streets of her Hells and her Paradise ached

    for her.


So she lived while her body corrupted upon her.

 And she called on the Night for a sign, and a Sign was allowed,

And she builded an Altar and served by the light of her Vision--

 Alone, without hope of regard or reward, but uncowed,

Resolute, selfless, divine.

 These things she did in Love's honour...

What is a God beside Woman? Dust and derision!

Smells are surer than sounds or sights

 And the little things remain,

  Riding in, in the rain.



  There was some silly fire on the flank

     And the small wet drizzling down--

  There were the sold-out shops and the bank

     And the wet, wide-open town;

   And we were doing escort-duty

     To somebody's baggage-train,

   And I smelt wattle by Lichtenberg--

    And my little homestead on Hunter River

      And my new vines joining hands.

    It all came over me in one act

       Quick as a shot through the brain--

     With the smell of the wattle round Lichtenberg,

If you've ever stole a pheasant-egg be'ind the keeper's back,

If you've ever snigged the washin' from the line,

If you've ever crammed a gander in your bloomin' 'aversack,

You will understand this little song o' mine.

But the service rules are 'ard, an' from such we are debarred,

For the same with English morals does not suit.

W'y, they call a man a robber if 'e stuffs 'is marchin' clobber

           Clap 'em forward with a Loo! loo! Lulu! Loot!

   (ff)  Whoopee!  Tear 'im, puppy!  Loo! loo! Lulu!  Loot! loot! loot!


If you've knocked a nigger edgeways when 'e's thrustin' for your life,

You must leave 'im very careful where 'e fell;

An' may thank your stars an' gaiters if you didn't feel 'is knife

That you ain't told off to bury 'im as well.

Then the sweatin' Tommies wonder as they spade the beggars under

Why lootin' should be entered as a crime;

So if my song you'll 'ear, I will learn you plain an' clear

'Ow to pay yourself for fightin' overtime.

(Chorus)  With the loot, . . .


Now remember when you're 'acking round a gilded Burma god

That 'is eyes is very often precious stones;

An' if you treat a nigger to a dose o' cleanin'-rod

'E's like to show you everything 'e owns.

When 'e won't prodooce no more, pour some water on the floor

Where you 'ear it answer 'ollow to the boot

When the ground begins to sink, shove your baynick down the chink,

An' you're sure to touch the --

(Chorus)  Loo! loo!  Lulu!   Loot! loot! loot!

              Ow the loot! . . .


When from 'ouse to 'ouse you're 'unting, you must always work in pairs --

It 'alves the gain, but safer you will find --

For a single man gets bottled on them twisty-wisty stairs,

An' a woman comes and clobs 'im from be'ind.

When you've turned 'em inside out, an' it seems beyond a doubt

As if there weren't enough to dust a flute

   (Cornet:  Toot! toot!) --

Before you sling your 'ook, at the 'ousetops take a look,

For it's underneath the tiles they 'ide the loot.

(Chorus)  Ow the loot! . . .


You can mostly square a Sergint an' a Quartermaster too,

If you only take the proper way to go;

I could never keep my pickin's, but I've learned you all I knew --

An' don't you never say I told you so.

An' now I'll bid good-bye, for I'm gettin' rather dry,

An' I see another tunin' up to toot

So 'ere's good-luck to those that wears the Widow's clo'es,

An' the Devil send 'em all they want o' loot!

Poem 157: Lord Roberts


He passed in the very battle-smoke

 Of the war that he had descried.

Three hundred mile of cannon spoke

 When the Master-Gunner died.


He passed to the very sound of the guns;

 But, before his eye grew dim,

He had seen the faces of the sons

 Whose sires had served with him,


He had touched their sword-hilts and greeted

  With the old sure word of praise;

And there was virtue in touch and speech

 As it had been in old days.


So he dismissed them and took his rest,

 And the steadfast spirit went forth

Between the adoring East and West

 And the tireless guns of the North.


Clean, simple, valiant, well-beloved,

 Flawless in faith and fame,

Whom neither ease nor honours moved

 An hair's-breadth from his aim.


Never again the war-wise face,

 The weighed and urgent word

That pleaded in the market-place-

 Pleaded and was not heard!


Yet from his life a new life springs

 Through all the hosts to come,

And Glory is the least of things

 That follow this man home.

Poem 158: Lukannon


I met my mates in the morning (and oh, but I am old!)

Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;

I heard them lift the chorus that dropped the breakers' song --

The beaches of Lukannon -- two million voices strong!


The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,

The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,

The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame --

The beaches of Lukannon -- before the sealers came!


I met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!);

They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.

And through the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach

We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.


The beaches of Lukannon -- the winter-wheat so tall --

The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!

The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!

The beaches of Lukannon -- the home where we were born!


I meet my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.

Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;

Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,

And still we sing Lukannon -- before the sealers came.


Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska go!

And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys! the story of our woe;

Ere, empty as the shark's egg the tempest flings ashore,

The beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!

Poem 159: M'Andrew's Hymn


Lord, Thou hast made this world below the shadow of a dream,

An', taught by time, I tak' it so -- exceptin' always Steam.

From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God --

Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod.

John Calvin might ha' forged the same -- enorrmous, certain, slow --

Ay, wrought it in the furnace-flame -- ~my~ "Institutio".

I cannot get my sleep to-night; old bones are hard to please;

I'll stand the middle watch up here -- alone wi' God an' these

My engines, after ninety days o' race an' rack an' strain

Through all the seas of all Thy world, slam-bangin' home again.

Slam-bang too much -- they knock a wee -- the crosshead-gibs are loose;

But thirty thousand mile o' sea has gied them fair excuse. . . .

Fine, clear an' dark -- a full-draught breeze, wi' Ushant out o' sight,

An' Ferguson relievin' Hay.  Old girl, ye'll walk to-night!

His wife's at Plymouth. . . .  Seventy --

 One -- Two -- Three since he began --

Three turns for Mistress Ferguson. . .and who's to blame the man?

There's none at any port for me, by drivin' fast or slow,

Since Elsie Campbell went to Thee, Lord, thirty years ago.

(The year the ~Sarah Sands~ was burned.  Oh roads we used to tread,

Fra' Maryhill to Pollokshaws -- fra' Govan to Parkhead!)

Not but they're ceevil on the Board.  Ye'll hear Sir Kenneth say:

"Good-morrn, M'Andrew!  Back again?  An' how's your bilge to-day?"

Miscallin' technicalities but handin' me my chair

To drink Madeira wi' three Earls -- the auld Fleet Engineer,

That started as a boiler-whelp -- when steam and he were low.

I mind the time we used to serve a broken pipe wi' tow.

Ten pound was all the pressure then -- Eh!  Eh! -- a man wad drive;

An' here, our workin' gauges give one hunder fifty-five!

We're creepin' on wi' each new rig -- less weight an' larger power:

There'll be the loco-boiler next an' thirty knots an hour!

Thirty an' more.  What I ha' seen since ocean-steam began

Leaves me no doot for the machine:  but what about the man?

The man that counts, wi' all his runs, one million mile o' sea:

Four time the span from earth to moon. . . .  How far, O Lord, from Thee?

That wast beside him night an' day.  Ye mind my first typhoon?

It scoughed the skipper on his way to jock wi' the saloon.

Three feet were on the stokehold-floor -- just slappin' to an' fro --

An' cast me on a furnace-door.  I have the marks to show.

Marks!  I ha' marks o' more than burns -- deep in my soul an' black,

An' times like this, when things go smooth, my wickudness comes back.

The sins o' four and forty years, all up an' down the seas,

Clack an' repeat like valves half-fed. . . .  Forgie's our trespasses.

Nights when I'd come on deck to mark, wi' envy in my gaze,

The couples kittlin' in the dark between the funnel stays;

Years when I raked the ports wi' pride to fill my cup o' wrong --

Judge not, O Lord, my steps aside at Gay Street in Hong-Kong!

Blot out the wastrel hours of mine in sin when I abode --

Jane Harrigan's an' Number Nine, The Reddick an' Grant Road!

An' waur than all -- my crownin' sin -- rank blasphemy an' wild.

I was not four and twenty then -- Ye wadna judge a child?

I'd seen the Tropics first that run -- new fruit, new smells, new air --

How could I tell -- blind-fou wi' sun -- the Deil was lurkin' there?

By day like playhouse-scenes the shore slid past our sleepy eyes;

By night those soft, lasceevious stars leered from those velvet skies,

In port (we used no cargo-steam) I'd daunder down the streets --

An ijjit grinnin' in a dream -- for shells an' parrakeets,

An' walkin'-sticks o' carved bamboo an' blowfish stuffed an' dried --

Fillin' my bunk wi' rubbishry the Chief put overside.

Till, off Sambawa Head, Ye mind, I heard a land-breeze ca',

Milk-warm wi' breath o' spice an' bloom:  "M'Andrew, come awa'!"

Firm, clear an' low -- no haste, no hate -- the ghostly whisper went,

Just statin' eevidential facts beyon' all argument:

"Your mither's God's a graspin' deil, the shadow o' yoursel',

Got out o' books by meenisters clean daft on Heaven an' Hell.

They mak' Him in the Broomielaw, o' Glasgie cold an' dirt,

A jealous, pridefu' fetich, lad, that's only strong to hurt,

Ye'll not go back to Him again an' kiss His red-hot rod,

But come wi' Us" (Now, who were ~They~?) "an' know the Leevin' God,

That does not kipper souls for sport or break a life in jest,

But swells the ripenin' cocoanuts an' ripes the woman's breast."

An' there it stopped:  cut off:  no more; that quiet, certain voice --

For me, six months o' twenty-four, to leave or take at choice.

'Twas on me like a thunderclap -- it racked me through an' through --

Temptation past the show o' speech, unnameable an' new --

The Sin against the Holy Ghost? . . .  An' under all, our screw.

That storm blew by but left behind her anchor-shiftin' swell,

Thou knowest all my heart an' mind, Thou knowest, Lord, I fell.

Third on the ~Mary Gloster~ then, and first that night in Hell!

Yet was Thy hand beneath my head, about my feet Thy care --

Fra' Deli clear to Torres Strait, the trial o' despair,

But when we touched the Barrier Reef Thy answer to my prayer!

We dared not run that sea by night but lay an' held our fire,

An' I was drowsin' on the hatch -- sick -- sick wi' doubt an' tire:

"~Better the sight of eyes that see than wanderin' o' desire!~"

Ye mind that word?  Clear as our gongs -- again, an' once again,

When rippin' down through coral-trash ran out our moorin'-chain;

An' by Thy Grace I had the Light to see my duty plain.

Light on the engine-room -- no more -- bright as our carbons burn.

I've lost it since a thousand times, but never past return.


Obsairve.  Per annum we'll have here two thousand souls aboard --

Think not I dare to justify myself before the Lord,

But -- average fifteen hunder souls safe-borne fra' port to port --

I ~am~ o' service to my kind.  Ye wadna blame the thought?

Maybe they steam from grace to wrath -- to sin by folly led, --

It isna mine to judge their path -- their lives are on my head.

Mine at the last -- when all is done it all comes back to me,

The fault that leaves six thousand ton a log upon the sea.

We'll tak' one stretch -- three weeks an' odd by any road ye steer --

Fra' Cape Town east to Wellington -- ye need an engineer.

Fail there -- ye've time to weld your shaft -- ay, eat it, ere ye're spoke;

Or make Kerguelen under sail -- three jiggers burned wi' smoke!

An' home again, the Rio run:  it's no child's play to go

Steamin' to bell for fourteen days o' snow an' floe an' blow --

The bergs like kelpies overside that girn an' turn an' shift

Whaur, grindin' like the Mills o' God, goes by the big South drift.

(Hail, snow an' ice that praise the Lord:  I've met them at their work,

An' wished we had anither route or they anither kirk.)

Yon's strain, hard strain, o' head an' hand, for though Thy Power brings

All skill to naught, Ye'll understand a man must think o' things.

Then, at the last, we'll get to port an' hoist their baggage clear --

The passengers, wi' gloves an' canes -- an' this is what I'll hear:

"Well, thank ye for a pleasant voyage.  The tender's comin' now."

While I go testin' follower-bolts an' watch the skipper bow.

They've words for every one but me -- shake hands wi' half the crew,

Except the dour Scots engineer, the man they never knew.

An' yet I like the wark for all we've dam' few pickin's here --

No pension, an' the most we earn's four hunder pound a year.

Better myself abroad?  Maybe.  ~I'd~ sooner starve than sail

Wi' such as call a snifter-rod ~ross~. . .French for nightingale.

Commeesion on my stores?  Some do; but I can not afford

To lie like stewards wi' patty-pans --.  I'm older than the Board.

A bonus on the coal I save?  Ou ay, the Scots are close,

But when I grudge the strength Ye gave I'll grudge their food to ~those~.

(There's bricks that I might recommend -- an' clink the fire-bars cruel.

No!  Welsh -- Wangarti at the worst -- an' damn all patent fuel!)

Inventions?  Ye must stay in port to mak' a patent pay.

My Deeferential Valve-Gear taught me how that business lay,

I blame no chaps wi' clearer head for aught they make or sell.

~I~ found that I could not invent an' look to these -- as well.

So, wrestled wi' Apollyon -- Nah! -- fretted like a bairn --

But burned the workin'-plans last run wi' all I hoped to earn.

Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an' what that meant to me --

E'en tak' it for a sacrifice acceptable to Thee. . . .

~Below there!  Oiler!  What's your wark?  Ye find it runnin' hard?

Ye needn't swill the cap wi' oil -- this isn't the Cunard!

Ye thought?  Ye are not paid to think.  Go, sweat that off again!~

Tck!  Tck!  It's deeficult to sweer nor tak' The Name in vain!

Men, ay an' women, call me stern.  Wi' these to oversee

Ye'll note I've little time to burn on social repartee.

The bairns see what their elders miss; they'll hunt me to an' fro,

Till for the sake of -- well, a kiss -- I tak' 'em down below.

That minds me of our Viscount loon -- Sir Kenneth's kin -- the chap

Wi' Russia leather tennis-shoon an' spar-decked yachtin'-cap.

I showed him round last week, o'er all -- an' at the last says he:

"Mister M'Andrew, don't you think steam spoils romance at sea?"

Damned ijjit!  I'd been doon that morn to see what ailed the throws,

Manholin', on my back -- the cranks three inches off my nose.

Romance!  Those first-class passengers they like it very well,

Printed an' bound in little books; but why don't poets tell?

I'm sick of all their quirks an' turns -- the loves an' doves they dream --

Lord, send a man like Robbie Burns to sing the Song o' Steam!

To match wi' Scotia's noblest speech yon orchestra sublime

Whaurto -- uplifted like the Just -- the tail-rods mark the time.

The crank-throws give the double-bass, the feed-pump sobs an' heaves,

An' now the main eccentrics start their quarrel on the sheaves:

Her time, her own appointed time, the rocking link-head bides,

Till -- hear that note? -- the rod's return

 whings glimmerin' through the guides.

They're all awa'!  True beat, full power, the clangin' chorus goes

Clear to the tunnel where they sit, my purrin' dynamos.

Interdependence absolute, foreseen, ordained, decreed,

To work, Ye'll note, at any tilt an' every rate o' speed.

Fra' skylight-lift to furnace-bars, backed, bolted, braced an' stayed,

An' singin' like the Mornin' Stars for joy that they are made;

While, out o' touch o' vanity, the sweatin' thrust-block says:

"Not unto us the praise, or man -- not unto us the praise!"

Now, a' together, hear them lift their lesson -- theirs an' mine:

"Law, Orrder, Duty an' Restraint, Obedience, Discipline!"

Mill, forge an' try-pit taught them that when roarin' they arose,

An' whiles I wonder if a soul was gied them wi' the blows.

Oh for a man to weld it then, in one trip-hammer strain,

Till even first-class passengers could tell the meanin' plain!

But no one cares except mysel' that serve an' understand

My seven thousand horse-power here.

 Eh, Lord!  They're grand -- they're grand!

Uplift am I?  When first in store the new-made beasties stood,

Were Ye cast down that breathed the Word declarin' all things good?

Not so!  O' that warld-liftin' joy no after-fall could vex,

Ye've left a glimmer still to cheer the Man -- the Arrtifex!

~That~ holds, in spite o' knock and scale, o' friction, waste an' slip,

An' by that light -- now, mark my word -- we'll build the Perfect Ship.

I'll never last to judge her lines or take her curve -- not I.

But I ha' lived an' I ha' worked. 'Be thanks to Thee, Most High!

An' I ha' done what I ha' done -- judge Thou if ill or well --

Always Thy Grace preventin' me. . . .

           Losh!  Yon's the "Stand by" bell.

Pilot so soon?  His flare it is.  The mornin'-watch is set.

Well, God be thanked, as I was sayin', I'm no Pelagian yet.

Now I'll tak' on. . . .

   ~'Morrn, Ferguson.  Man, have ye ever thought

What your good leddy costs in coal? . . .  I'll burn 'em down to port.

Poem 160: Macdonough's Song


Whether the State can loose and bind

  In Heaven as well as on Earth:

If it be wiser to kill mankind

 Before or after the birth--

These are matters of high concern

  Where State-kept schoolmen are;

But Holy State (we have lived to learn)

   Endeth in Holy War.


Whether The People be led by The Lord,

   Or lured by the loudest throat:

If it be quicker to die by the sword

 Or cheaper to die by vote--

These are things we have dealt with once,

 (And they will not rise from their grave)

For Holy People, however it runs,

 Endeth in wholly Slave.


Whatsoever, for any cause,

   Seeketh to take or give

Power above or beyond the Laws,

   Suffer it not to live!

Holy State or Holy King--

  Or Holy People's Will--

Have no truck with the senseless thing.

  Order the guns and kill!

       Saying --after--me:--


Once there was The People--Terror gave it birth;

Once there was The People and it made a Hell of Earth.

Earth arose and crushed it. Listen, O ye slain!

Once there was The People--it shall never be again!

Poem 161: Mandalay


By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' eastward to the sea,

There's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me;

For the wind is in the palm-trees, and the temple-bells they say:

"Come you back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay!"

    Come you back to Mandalay,

    Where the old Flotilla lay:

    Can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from Rangoon to Mandalay?

    On the road to Mandalay,

    Where the flyin'-fishes play,

    An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!


'Er petticoat was yaller an' 'er little cap was green,

An' 'er name was Supi-yaw-lat -- jes' the same as Theebaw's Queen,

An' I seed her first a-smokin' of a whackin' white cheroot,

An' a-wastin' Christian kisses on an 'eathen idol's foot:

    Bloomin' idol made o'mud --

    Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd --

    Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed 'er where she stud!

    On the road to Mandalay . . .


When the mist was on the rice-fields an' the sun was droppin' slow,

She'd git 'er little banjo an' she'd sing "~Kulla-lo-lo!~"

With 'er arm upon my shoulder an' 'er cheek agin' my cheek

We useter watch the steamers an' the ~hathis~ pilin' teak.

    Elephints a-pilin' teak

    In the sludgy, squdgy creek,

    Where the silence 'ung that 'eavy you was 'arf afraid to speak!

    On the road to Mandalay . . .


But that's all shove be'ind me -- long ago an' fur away,

An' there ain't no 'busses runnin' from the Bank to Mandalay;

An' I'm learnin' 'ere in London what the ten-year soldier tells:

"If you've 'eard the East a-callin', you won't never 'eed naught else."

    No! you won't 'eed nothin' else

    But them spicy garlic smells,

    An' the sunshine an' the palm-trees an' the tinkly temple-bells;

    On the road to Mandalay . . .


I am sick o' wastin' leather on these gritty pavin'-stones,

An' the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones;

Tho' I walks with fifty 'ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand,

An' they talks a lot o' lovin', but wot do they understand?

    Beefy face an' grubby 'and --

    Law! wot do they understand?

    I've a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land!

    On the road to Mandalay . . .


Ship me somewheres east of Suez, where the best is like the worst,

Where there aren't no Ten Commandments an' a man can raise a thirst;

For the temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that I would be --

By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea;

    On the road to Mandalay,

    Where the old Flotilla lay,

    With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay!

    On the road to Mandalay,

    Where the flyin'-fishes play,

    An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!

Poem 165: Merrow Down


I


There runs a road by Merrow Down--

 A grassy track to-day it is--

An hour out Guildford town,

 Above the river Wey it is.


Here, when they heard the hors-bells ring,

 The ancient Britons dressed and rode

To which the dark Phoenicians bring

 Their goods along the Western Road.


Yes, here, or hereabouts, they met

 To hold their racial talks and such--

To barter beads for Whitby jet,

 And tin for gay shell torques and such.


But long ago before that time

 (When bison used to roam on it)

Did Taffy and her Daddy climb

 That Down, and had their home on it.


Then beavers built in Broadstonebrook

 And made a swamp where Bramley stands;

And bears from Shere would come and look

 For Taffimai where Shamley stands.


The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,

 Was more than six times bigger then;

And all the Tribe of Tegumai

 They cut a noble figure then!



                    II


Of all the Tribe of Tegumai

 Who cut that figure, none remain,--

On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry--

 The silence and the sun remain.


But as the faithful years return

 And hearts unwounded sing again,

Comes Taffy dancing through the fern

  To lead the Surrey spring again.


Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,

  And golden elf-locks fly above;

Her eyes are bright as diamonds

  And bluer than the sky above.


In moccasins and deer-skin cloak,

   Unfearing, free and fair she flits,

And lights her little damp-wood smoke

  To show her Daddy where she flits.


 For far--oh, very far behind,

    So far she cannot call to him,

 Comes Tegumai alone to find

    The daughter that was all to him!

Poem 166: Mesopotamia


They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young,

 The eager and whole-hearted whom we gave:

But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung,

 Shall they come with years and honour to the grave?


They shall not return to us; the strong men coldly slain

 In sight of help denied from day to day:

But the men who edged their agonies and chid them in their pain,

 Are they too strong and wise to put away?


Our dead shall not return to us while Day and Night divide--

 Never while the bars of sunset hold.

But the idle-minded overlings who quibbled while they died,

 Shall they thrust for high employments as of old?


Shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour:

 When the storm is ended shall we find

How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power

 By the favour and contrivance of their kind?


Even while they soothe us, while they promise large amends,

 Even while they make a show of fear,

Do they call upon their debtors,  and  take  counsel  with  their

    friends,

 To conform and re-establish each career?


Their lives cannot repay us--their death could not undo--

 The shame that they have laid upon our race.

But the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew,

 Shell we leave it unabated in its place?

Poem 167: Mine-Sweepers


Dawn off the Foreland -- the young flood making

Jumbled and short and steep --

Black in the hollows and bright where it's breaking --

Awkward water to sweep.

"Mines reported in the fairway,

Warn all traffic and detain.

Sent up Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden Gain."


Noon off the Foreland -- the first ebb making

Lumpy and strong in the bight.

Boom after boom, and the golf-hut shaking

And the jackdaws wild with fright.

"Mines located in the fairway,

Boats now working up the chain,

Sweepers -- Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden Gain."


Dusk off the Foreland -- the last light going

And the traffic crowding through,

And five damned trawlers with their syreens blowing

Heading the whole review!

"Sweep completed in the fairway,

No more mines remain.

Sent back Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden Gain."

Poem 170: Mowgli's Song


The Song of Mowgli -- I, Mowgli, am singing. Let

     the jungle listen to the things I have done.

Shere Khan said he would kill -- would kill! At the

     gates in the twilight he would kill Mowgli, the

     Frog!

He ate and he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for

     when wilt thou drink again? Sleep and dream

     of the kill.

I am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother,

     come to me! Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there

     is big game afoot.

Bring up the great bull-buffaloes, the blue-skinned

     herd-bulls with the angry eyes. Drive them to

     and fro as I order.

Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, O wake!

     Here come I, and the bulls are behind.

Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his

     foot. Waters of the Waingunga, whither went

     Shere Khan?

He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that

     he should fly. He is not Mang, the Bat, to hang

     in the branches. Little bamboos that creak to-

     gether, tell me where he ran?

Ow! He is there. Ahoo! He is there. Under the

     feet of Rama lies the Lame One! Up, Shere

     Khan! Up and kill! Here is meat; break the

     necks of the bulls!

Hsh! He is asleep. We will not wake him, for his

     strength is very great. The kites have come down

     to see it. The black ants have come up to know

     it. There is a great assembly in his honour.

Alala! I have no cloth to wrap me. The kites will

     see that I am naked. I am ashamed to meet all

     these people.

Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay

     striped coat that I may go to the Council Rock.

By the Bull that bought me I have made a promise --

     a little promise. Only thy coat is lacking before I

     keep my word.

With the knife -- with the knife that men use -- with

     the knife of the hunter, the man, I will stoop down

     for my gift.

Waters of the Waingunga, bear witness that Shere

     Khan gives me his coat for the love that he bears

     me. Pull, Gray Brother! Pull, Akela! Heavy is

     the hide of Shere Khan.

The Man Pack are angry. They throw stones and talk

     child's talk. My mouth is bleeding. Let us run

     away.

Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly

     with me, my brothers. We will leave the lights

     of the village and go to the low moon.

Waters of the Waingunga, the Man Pack have cast me

     out. I did them no harm, but they were afraid of

     me. Why?

Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too. The jungle is

     shut to me and the village gates are shut. Why?

As Mang flies between the beasts and the birds so fly

     I between the village and the jungle. Why?

I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is

     very heavy. My mouth is cut and wounded with

     the stones from the village, but my heart is very

     light because I have come back to the jungle.

     Why?

These two things fight together in me as the snakes

     fight in the spring. The water comes out of my

     eyes; yet I laugh while it falls. Why?

I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under

     my feet.

All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.

     Look -- look well, O Wolves!

Ahae! My heart is heavy with the things that I do

     not understand.


Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,

     And black are the waters that sparkled so green.

The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us

     At rest in the hollows that rustle between.

Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;

     Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!

The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,

     Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas.

Poem 171: Mowgli's Song Against People


I will let loose against you the fleet-footed vines--

I will call in the Jungle to stamp out your lines!

    The roofs shall fade before it,

      The house-beams shall  fall;

    And the Karela, the bitter Karela,

      Shall cover it all!


In the gates of these your councils my people shall sing.

In the doors of these your garners the Bat-folk shall cling;

    And the snake shall be your watchman,

      By a hearthstone unswept;

    For the Karela, the bitter Karela,

      Shall fruit where ye slept!


Ye shall not see my strikers; ye shall hear them and guess.

By night, before the moon-rise, I will send for my cess,

    And the wolf shall be your herdsman

      By a landmark removed;

    For the Karela, the bitter Karela,

      Shall seed where ye loved!


I will reap your fields before you at the hands of a host.

Ye shall glean behind my reapers for the bread that is lost;

    And the deer shall be your oxen

      On a headland untilled;

    For the Karela, the bitter Karela,

      Shall leaf where ye build!


I have untied against you the club-footed vines--

I have sent in the Jungle to swamp out your lines!

    The trees--the trees are on you!

      The house-beams shall fall;

    And the Karela, the bitter Karela,

      Shall cover you all!

Poem 172: Mulholland's Contract


The fear was on the cattle, for the gale was on the sea,

An' the pens broke up on the lower deck an' let the creatures free --

An' the lights went out on the lower deck, an' no one near but me.


I had been singin' to them to keep 'em quiet there,

For the lower deck is the dangerousest, requirin' constant care,

An' give to me as the strongest man, though used to drink and swear.


I see my chance was certain of bein' horned or trod,

For the lower deck was packed with steers thicker'n peas in a pod,

An' more pens broke at every roll -- so I made a Contract with God.


An' by the terms of the Contract, as I have read the same,

If He got me to port alive I would exalt His Name,

An' praise His Holy Majesty till further orders came.


He saved me from the cattle an' He saved me from the sea,

For they found me 'tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed me --

An' a four-inch crack on top of my head, as crazy as could be.


But that were done by a stanchion, an' not by a bullock at all,

An' I lay still for seven weeks convalessing of the fall,

An' readin' the shiny Scripture texts in the Seaman's Hospital.


An' I spoke to God of our Contract, an' He says to my prayer:

"I never puts on My ministers no more than they can bear.

So back you go to the cattle-boats an' preach My Gospel there.


"For human life is chancy at any kind of trade,

But most of all, as well you know, when the steers are mad-afraid;

So you go back to the cattle-boats an' preach 'em as I've said.


"They must quit drinkin' an' swearin', they mustn't knife on a blow,

They must quit gamblin' their wages, and you must preach it so;

For now those boats are more like Hell than anything else I know."


I didn't want to do it, for I knew what I should get,

An' I wanted to preach Religion, handsome an' out of the wet,

But the Word of the Lord were lain on me, an' I done what I was set.


I have been smit an' bruis]ed, as warned would be the case,

An' turned my cheek to the smiter exactly as Scripture says;

But following that, I knocked him down an' led him up to Grace.


An' we have preaching on Sundays whenever the sea is calm,

An' I use no knife or pistol an' I never take no harm,

For the Lord abideth back of me to guide my fighting arm.


An' I sign for four-pound-ten a month and save the money clear,

An' I am in charge of the lower deck, an' I never lose a steer;

An' I believe in Almighty God an' preach His Gospel here.


The skippers say I'm crazy, but I can prove 'em wrong,

For I am in charge of the lower deck with all that doth belong --

~Which they would not give to a lunatic, and the competition so strong!~

Poem 173: Municipal


"Why is my District death-rate low?"

 Said Binks of Hezabad.

"Well, drains, and sewage-outfalls are

 "My own peculiar fad.

"I learnt a lesson once, It ran

"Thus," quoth that most veracious man: --



It was an August evening and, in snowy garments clad,

I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad;

When, presently, my Waler saw, and did not like at all,

A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall.


I couldn't see he driver, and across my mind it rushed

That that Commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth.

I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down,

So I let the Waler have it, and we headed for the town.


The buggy was a new one and, praise Dykes, it stood the strain,

Till he Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain;

And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals,

And the creature making toothpicks of my five-foot patent wheels.


He seemed to want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear,

To the Main Drain sewage-outfall while he snorted in my ear --

Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in darkness and despair,

Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair.


Heard it trumpet on my shoulder -- tried to crawl a little higher --

Found the Main Drain sewage outfall blocked, some eight feet up, with mire;

And, for twenty reeking minutes, Sir, my very marrow froze,

While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes!


It missed me by a fraction, but my hair was turning grey

Before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away.

Then I sought the City Elders, and my words were very plain.

They flushed that four-foot drain-head and -- it never choked again!


You may hold with surface-drainage, and the sun-for-garbage cure,

Till you've been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer.

I believe in well-flushed culverts. . . .

                                 This is why the death-rate's small;

And, if you don't believe me, get shikarred yourself. That's all.

Poem 176: My Lady's Law


The Law whereby my lady moves

         Was never Law to me,

         But 'tis enough that she approves  

         Whatever Law it be.


         For in that Law, and by that Law

         My constant course I'll steer;    

         Not that I heed or deem it dread,

         But that she holds it dear.


         Tho' Asia sent for my content

         Her richest argosies,

         Those would  I spurn, and bid return,

         If that should give her ease.


         With equal heart I'd watch depart

         Each spiced sail from sight;

         Sans bitterness, desiring less

         Great gear than her delight.


         Though Kings made swift with many a gift

         My proven sword to hire--

         I would not go nor serve 'em so--

         Except at her desire.


         With even mind, I'd put behind

         Adventure and acclaim,

         And clean give o'er, esteeming more

         Her favour than my fame.


         Yet such am I, yea, such am I--

         Sore bond and freest free,

         The Law that sways my lady's ways

         Is mystery to me!

Poem 177: My Rival


I go to concert, party, ball --

 What profit is in these?

I sit alone against the wall

 And strive to look at ease.

The incense that is mine by right

 They burn before her shrine;

And that's because I'm seventeen

 And She is forty-nine.


I cannot check my girlish blush,

 My color comes and goes;

I redden to my finger-tips,

 And sometimes to my nose.

But She is white where white should be,

 And red where red should shine.

The blush that flies at seventeen

 Is fixed at forty-nine.


I wish I had Her constant cheek;

 I wish that I could sing

All sorts of funny little songs,

 Not quite the proper thing.

I'm very gauche and very shy,

 Her jokes aren't in my line;

And, worst of all, I'm seventeen

 While She is forty-nine.


The young men come, the young men go

 Each pink and white and neat,

She's older than their mothers, but

 They grovel at Her feet.

They walk beside Her 'rickshaw wheels --

 None ever walk by mine;

And that's because I'm seventeen

 And She is foty-nine.


She rides with half a dozen men,

 (She calls them "boys" and "mashers")

I trot along the Mall alone;

 My prettiest frocks and sashes

Don't help to fill my programme-card,

 And vainly I repine

From ten to two A.M. Ah me!

 Would I were forty-nine!


She calls me "darling," "pet," and "dear,"

 And "sweet retiring maid."

I'm always at the back, I know,

 She puts me in the shade.

She introduces me to men,

 "Cast" lovers, I opine,

For sixty takes to seventeen,

 Nineteen to foty-nine.


But even She must older grow

 And end Her dancing days,

She can't go on forever so

 At concerts, balls and plays.

One ray of priceless hope I see

 Before my footsteps shine;

Just think, that She'll be eighty-one

 When I am forty-nine.

   And stranded after a month at sea.   .   .   .

There is a pain in my inside.

 Why have the Gods afflicted me?

Ow! I am purged till I am a wraith!

Wow! I am sick till I cannot see!

What is the sense of Religion and Faith:

 Look how the Gods have afflicted me!



Pagan


How can the skin of rat or mouse hold

 Anything more than a harmless flea?.   .   .

The burning plague has taken my household.

 Why have my Gods afflicted me?

All my kith and kin are deceased,

 Though they were as good as good could be,

I will out and batter the family priest,

 Because my Gods have afflicted me!

 After the custom of Christendie.   .   .   .

Fevers and fluxes are wasting my mother.

 Why has the Lord afflicted me?

The Saints are helpless for all I offer--

 So are the clergy I used to fee.

Henceforward I keep my cash in my coffer,

 Because the Lord has afflicted me.

We had a kettle: we let it leak:

 Our not repairing it made it worse.

We haven't had any tea for a week.   .   .

Conclusion


This was none of the good Lord's pleasure,

  For the Spirit He breathed in Man is free;

But what comes after is measure for measure,

As was the sowing so the reaping

 Is now and evermore shall be.

Thou art delivered to thine own keeping.

 Only  Thyself hath afflicted thee!

But he that is costive of soul toward his fellow,

 Through the ways, and the works, and the woes of this life,

Him food shall not fatten, him drink shall not mellow;

 And his innards shall brew him perpetual strife.

His eye shall be blind to God's Glory above him;

His Friends and his Club and his Dog shall not love him;

Poem 180: Norman and Saxon


My son," said the Norman Baron, "I am dying, and you will be heir

To all the broad acres in England that William gave me for my share

When we conquered the Saxon at Hastings, and a nice little handful it is.

But before you go over to rule it I want you to understand this:—


"The Saxon is not like us Normans, His manners are not so polite.

But he never means anything serious till he talks about justice and right.

When he stands like an ox in the furrow with his sullen set eyes on your own,

And grumbles, "This isn't fair dealings," my son, leave the Saxon alone.


"You can horsewhip your Gascony archers, or torture your Picardy spears,

But don't try that game on the Saxon; you'll have the whole brood round your ears.

From the richest old Thane in the county to the poorest chained serf in the field,

They'll be at you and on you like hornets, and, if you are wise, you will yield.


"But first you must master their language, their dialect, proverbs and songs.

Don't trust any clerk to interpret when they come with the tale of their wrongs.

Let them know that you know what they're saying; let them feel that you know what to say.

Yes, even when you want to go hunting, hear 'em out if it takes you all day.


"They'll drink every hour of the daylight and poach every hour of the dark,

It's the sport not the rabbits they 're after (we 've plenty of game in the park).

Don't hang them or cut off their fingers. That's wasteful as well as unkind,

For a hard-bitten, South-country poacher makes the best man-at-arms you can find.


"Appear with your wife and the children at their weddings and funerals and feasts.

Be polite but not friendly to Bishops; be good to all poor parish priests.

Say 'we,' 'us' and 'ours' when you're talking instead of 'you fellows' and 'I.'

Don't ride over seeds; keep your temper; and never you tell 'em a lie!"

An' trotted down the churchyard-path as fast as she could make.

She met the Parson walking, but she says to him, says she: --

"Oh, don't let no one trouble for a poor old ghost like me!"


'Twas all a warm September an' the hops had flourished grand.

An' none of 'em was foreigners but all which she had known,

And old Mother Laidinwool she blessed 'em every one.

So here's your Empire. No more wine, then?

Good.

We'll clear the Aides and khitmatgars away.

(You'll know that fat old fellow with the knife --

He keeps the Name Book, talks in English too,

And almost thinks himself the Government.)

O Youth, Youth, Youth! Forgive me, you're so young.

Forty from sixty -- twenty years of work

And power to back the working. Ay def mi!

You want to know, you want to see, to touch,

And, by your lights, to act. It's natural.

I wonder can I help you. Let me try.

You saw -- what did you see from Bombay east?

Enough to frighten any one but me?

Neat that! It frightened Me in Eighty-Four!

You shouldn't take a man from Canada

And bid him smoke in powder-magazines;

Nor with a Reputation such as -- Bah!

That ghost has haunted me for twenty years,

My Reputation now full blown -- Your fault --

Yours, with your stories of the strife at Home,

Who's up, who's down, who leads and who is led --

One reads so much, one hears so little here.

Well, now's your turn of exile. I go back

To Rome and leisure. All roads lead to Rome,


Or books -- the refuge of the destitute.

When you ... that brings me back to India. See!

 Start clear. I couldn't. Egypt served my turn.

You'll never plumb the Oriental mind,

And if you did it isn't worth the toil.

Think of a sleek French priest in Canada;

Divide by twenty half-breeds. Multiply

By twice the Sphinx's silence. There's your East,

And you're as wise as ever. So am I.

 Accept on trust and work in darkness, strike

At venture, stumble forward, make your mark,

(It's chalk on granite), then thank God no flame

Leaps from the rock to shrivel mark and man.

I'm clear -- my mark is made. Three months of drought

Had ruined much. It rained and washed away

The specks that might have gathered on my Name.

I took a country twice the size of France,

And shuttered up one doorway in the North.

I stand by those. You'll find that both will pay,

I pledged my Name on both -- they're yours to-night.

Hold to them -- they hold fame enough for two.

I'm old, but I shall live till Burma pays.

Men there -- not German traders -- Crsthw-te knows --

You'll find it in my papers. For the North

Guns always -- quietly -- but always guns.

You've seen your Council? Yes, they'll try to rule,

And prize their Reputations. Have you met

A grim lay-reader with a taste for coins,

And faith in Sin most men withhold from God?

He's gone to England. R-p-n knew his grip

And kicked. A Council always has its H-pes.

They look for nothing from the West but Death

Or Bath or Bournemouth. Here's their ground.

       They fight

Until the middle classes take them back,

One of ten millions plus a C.S.I.

Or drop in harness. Legion of the Lost?

Not altogether -- earnest, narrow men,

But chiefly earnest, and they'll do your work,

And end by writing letters to the Times,

(Shall I write letters, answering H-nt-r -- fawn

With R-p-n on the Yorkshire grocers? Ugh!)

They have their Reputations. Look to one --

I work with him -- the smallest of them all,

White-haired, red-faced, who sat the plunging horse

Out in the garden. He's your right-hand man,

And dreams of tilting W-ls-y from the throne,

But while he dreams gives work we cannot buy;

He has his Reputation -- wants the Lords

By way of Frontier Roads. Meantime, I think,

He values very much the hand that falls

Upon his shoulder at the Council table --

Hates cats and knows his business; which is yours.

 Your business! twice a hundred million souls.

Your business! I could tell you what I did

Some nights of Eighty-Five, at Simla, worth

A Kingdom's ransom. When a big ship drives,

God knows to what new reef the man at the whee!

Prays with the passengers. They lose their lives,

Or rescued go their way; but he's no man

To take his trick at the wheel again -- that's worse

Than drowning. Well, a galled Mashobra mule

(You'll see Mashobra) passed me on the Mall,

And I was -- some fool's wife and ducked and bowed

To show the others I would stop and speak.

Then the mule fell -- three galls, a hund-breadth each,

Behind the withers. Mrs. Whatsisname

Leers at the mule and me by turns, thweet thoul!

"How could they make him carry such a load!"

I saw -- it isn't often I dream dreams --

More than the mule that minute -- smoke and flame

From Simla to the haze below. That's weak.

You're younger. You'll dream dreams before you've done.

You've youth, that's one -- good workmen -- that means two

Fair chances in your favor. Fate's the third.

I know what I did. Do you ask me, "Preach"?

I answer by my past or else go back

To platitudes of rule -- or take you thus

In confidence and say: "You know the trick:

You've governed Canada. You know. You know!"

And all the while commend you to Fate's hand

(Here at the top on loses sight o' God),

Commend you, then, to something more than you --

The Other People's blunders and

 . . . that's all.

I'd agonize to serve you if I could.

It's incommunicable, like the cast

That drops the tackle with the gut adry.

Too much -- too little -- there's your salmon lost!

And so I tell you nothing --with you luck,

And wonder -- how I wonder! -- for your sake

And triumph for my own. You're young, you're young,

You hold to half a hundred Shibboleths.

I'm old. I followed Power to the last,

Gave her my best, and Power followed Me.

It's worth it -- on my soul I'm speaking plain,

Here by the claret glasses! -- worth it all.

I gave -- no matter what I gave -- I win.

I know I win. Mine's work, good work that lives!

A country twice the size of France -- the North

Safeguarded. That's my record: sink the rest

And better if you can. The Rains may serve,

Rupees may rise -- three pence will give you Fame --

It's rash to hope for sixpence -- If they rise

Get guns, more guns, and lift the salt-tax.

Oh!

I told you what the Congress meant or thought?

I'll answer nothing. Half a year will prove

The full extent of time and thought you'll spare

To Congress. Ask a Lady Doctor once

How little Begums see the light -- deduce

Thence how the True Reformer's child is born.

Bled pure Parisian ichor; and he purred.

The Congress doesn't purr. I think it swears.

You're young -- you'll swear to ere you've reached the end.

The End! God help you, if there be a God.

(There must be one to startle Gl-dst-ne's soul

In that new land where all the wires are cut.

And Cr-ss snores anthems on the asphodel.)

God help you! And I'd help you if I could,

But that's beyond me. Yes, your speech was crude.

Sound claret after olives -- yours and mine;

But Medoc slips into vin ordinaire.

(I'll drink my first at Genoa to your health.)

Raise it to Hock. You'll never catch my style.

And, after all, the middle-classes grip

The middle-class -- for Brompton talk Earl's Court.

Perhaps you're right. I'll see you in the Times --

A quarter-column of eye-searing print,

A leader once a quarter -- then a war;

The Strand abellow through the fog: "Defeat!"

"'Orrible slaughter!" While you lie awake

And wonder. Oh, you'll wonder ere you're free!

I wonder now. The four years slide away

So fast, so fast, and leave me here alone.

R-y, C-lv-n, L-l, R-b-rts, B-ck, the rest,

Princes and Powers of Darkness troops and trains,

 (I cannot sleep in trains), land piled on land,

Whitewash and weariness, red rockets, dust,

White snows that mocked me, palaces -- with draughts,

And W-stl-nd with the drafts he couldn't pay,

Poor W-ls-n reading his obituary.

Before he died, and H-pe, the man with bones,

And A-tch-s-n a dripping mackintosh

At Council in the Rains, his grating "Sirrr"

Half drowned by H-nt-r's silky: "Bat my lahnd."

Hunterian always: M-rsh-l spinning plates

Or standing on his head; the Rent Bill's roar,

A hundred thousand speeches, must red cloth,

And Smiths thrice happy if I call them Jones,

(I can't remember half their names) or reined

My pony on the Mall to greet their wives.

More trains, more troops, more dust, and then all's done.

Four years, and I forget. If I forget

How will they bear me in their minds? The North

Safeguarded -- nearly (R-b-rts knows the rest),

A country twice the size of France annexed.

That stays at least. The rest may pass -- may pass --

Your heritage -- and I can teach you nought.

"High trust," "vast honor," "interests twice as vast,"

"Due reverence to your Council" -- keep to those.

I envy you the twenty years you've gained,

But not the five to follow. What's that? One?

Two! -- Surely not so late. Good-night. Don't dream.

Poem 184: Oonts


Wot makes the soldier's 'eart to penk, wot makes 'im to perspire?

It isn't standin' up to charge nor lyin' down to fire;

But it's everlastin' waitin' on a everlastin' road

For the commissariat camel an' 'is commissariat load.

   O the oont, O the oont, O the commissariat oont!

    With 'is silly neck a-bobbin' like a basket full o' snakes;

   We packs 'im like an idol, an' you ought to 'ear 'im grunt,

    An' when we gets 'im loaded up 'is blessed girth-rope breaks.


Camel: -- ~oo~ is pronounced like ~u~ in "bull", but by Mr. Atkins

to rhyme with "front".


Wot makes the rear-guard swear so 'ard when night is drorin' in,

An' every native follower is shiverin' for 'is skin?

It ain't the chanst o' being rushed by Paythans from the 'ills,

It's the commissariat camel puttin' on 'is bloomin' frills!

   O the oont, O the oont, O the hairy scary oont!

    A-trippin' over tent-ropes when we've got the night alarm!

   We socks 'im with a stretcher-pole an' 'eads 'im off in front,

    An' when we've saved 'is bloomin' life 'e chaws our bloomin' arm.


The 'orse 'e knows above a bit, the bullock's but a fool,

The elephant's a gentleman, the battery-mule's a mule;

But the commissariat cam-u-el, when all is said an' done,

'E's a devil an' a ostrich an' a orphan-child in one.

   O the oont, O the oont, O the Gawd-forsaken oont!

    The lumpy-'umpy 'ummin'-bird a-singin' where 'e lies,

   'E's blocked the whole division from the rear-guard to the front,

    An' when we get him up again -- the beggar goes an' dies!


'E'll gall an' chafe an' lame an' fight -- 'e smells most awful vile;

'E'll lose 'isself for ever if you let 'im stray a mile;

'E's game to graze the 'ole day long an' 'owl the 'ole night through,

An' when 'e comes to greasy ground 'e splits 'isself in two.

   O the oont, O the oont, O the floppin', droppin' oont!

    When 'is long legs give from under an' 'is meltin' eye is dim,

   The tribes is up be'ind us, and the tribes is out in front --

    It ain't no jam for Tommy, but it's kites an' crows for 'im.


So when the cruel march is done, an' when the roads is blind,

An' when we sees the camp in front an' 'ears the shots be'ind,

Ho! then we strips 'is saddle off, and all 'is woes is past:

'E thinks on us that used 'im so, and gets revenge at last.

   O the oont, O the oont, O the floatin', bloatin' oont!

    The late lamented camel in the water-cut 'e lies;

   We keeps a mile be'ind 'im an' we keeps a mile in front,

    But 'e gets into the drinkin'-casks, and then o' course we dies.

Poem 185: Our Fathers Also


Thrones, Powers, Dominions, Peoples, Kings,

Are changing 'neath our hand.

Our fathers also see these things

But they do not understand.


By--they are by with mirth and tears,

Wit or the works of Desire-

Cushioned about on the kindly years

Between the wall and the fire.


The grapes are pressed, the corn is shocked--

Standeth no more to glean;

For the Gates of Love and Learning locked

When they went out between.


All lore our Lady Venus bares,

Signalled it was or told

By the dear lips long given to theirs

And longer to the mould.


All Profit, all Device, all Truth,

Written it was or said

By the mighty men of their mighty youth,

Which is mighty being dead.


The film that floats before their eyes

The Temple's Veil they call;

And the dust that on the Shewbread lies

Is holy over all.


Warn them of seas that slip our yoke,

Of slow-conspiring stars-

The ancient Front of Things unbroke

But heavy with new wars?


By--they are by with mirth and tears,

Wit or the waste of Desire-

Cushioned about on the kindly years

Between the wall and the fire!

Poem 186: Our Fathers of Old


Excellent herbs had our fathers of old--

          Excellent herbs to ease their pain--

        Alexanders and Marigold,

         Eyebright, Orris, and Elecampane--

        Basil, Rocket, Valerian, Rue,

          ( Almost singing themselves they run)

       Vervain, Dittany, Call-me-to-you--

           Cowslip, Melilot, Rose of the Sun.

           Anything green that grew out of the mould

           Was an excellent herb to our fathers of old.


         Wonderful tales had our fathers of old,

           Wonderful tales of the herbs and the stars-

        The Sun was Lord of the Marigold,

          Basil and Rocket belonged to Mars.

       Pat as a sum in division it goes--

          (Every herb had a planet bespoke)--

      Who but Venus should govern the Rose?

         Who but Jupiter own the Oak?

             Simply and gravely the facts are told

             In the wonderful books of our fathers of old.


  Wonderful little, when all is said,

    Wonderful little our fathers knew.

  Half their remedies cured you dead--

    Most of their teaching was quite untrue--

  "Look at the stars when  a patient is  ill.

     (Dirt has nothing to do with disease),

  Bleed and blister as much as you will,

    Bister and bleed him as oft as you please."

     Whence enormous and manifold

      Errors were made by our fathers of old.


 Yet when the sickness was sore in the land,

    And neither planets nor herbs assuaged,

 They took their lives in their lancet-hand

   And, oh, what a wonderful war they waged!

 Yes, when the crosses were chalked on the door-

    (Yes, when the terrible dead-cart rolled! )

 Excellent courage our fathers bore--

    None too learned, but nobly bold

    Into the fight went our fathers of old.


If it be certain, as Galen says--

 And sage Hippocrates holds as much--

"That those afflicted by doubts and dismays

 Are mightily helped by a dead man's touch,"

Then, be good to us, stars above!

 Then, be good to us, herbs below!

We are afflicted by what we can prove,

 We are distracted by what we know.

            So-ah, so!

  Down from your heaven or up from your mould

  Send us the hearts of our Fathers of old!

Poem 187: Outsong in the Jungle


Baloo


For the sake of him who showed

One wise Frog the Jungle-Road,

Keep the Law the Man-Pack make

For thy blind old Baloo's sake!

Clean or tainted, hot or stale,

Hold it as it were the Trail,

Through the day and through the night,

Questing neither left nor right.

For the sake of him who loves

Thee beyond all else that moves,

When thy Pack would make thee pain,

Say: " Tabaqui sings again."

When thy Pack would work thee ill,

Say:  "Shere Khan is yet to kill."

When the knife is drawn to slay,

Keep the Law and go thy way.

(Root and honey, palm and spathe,

Guard a cub from harm and scathe!)

Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,

Jungle-Favour go with thee!



Kaa


Anger is the egg of Fear--

Only lidless eyes see clear.

Cobra-poison none may leech--

Even so with Cobra-speech.

Open talk shall call to thee

Strength, whose mate is Courtesy.

Send no lunge beyond thy length.

Lend no rotten bough thy strength.

Gauge thy gape with buck or goat,

Lest thine eye should choke thy throat.

After gorging, wouldst thou sleep ?

Look thy den be hid and deep,

Lest a wrong, by thee forgot,

Draw thy killer to the spot.

East and West and North and South,

Wash thy hide and close thy mouth.

(Pit and rift and blue pool-brim,

Middle-Jungle follow him!)

Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,

Jungle-Favour go with thee!



Bagheera


In the cage my life began;

Well I know the worth of Man.

By the Broken Lock that freed--

Man-cub, ware the Man-cub's breed!

Scenting-dew or starlight pale,

Choose no tangled tree-cat trail.

Pack or council, hunt or den,

Cry no truce with Jackal-Men.

Feed them silence when they say:

"Come with us an easy way."

Feed them silence when they seek

Help of thine to hurt the weak.



Make no bandar's boast of skill;

Hold thy peace above the kill.

Let nor call nor song nor sign

Turn thee from thy hunting-line.

(Morning mist or twilight clear,

Serve him, Wardens of the Deer!)

Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,

Jungle-Favour go with thee!



The Three


On the trail that thou must tread

To the threshold of our dread,

Where the Flower blossoms red;

Through the nights when thou shalt lie

Prisoned from our Mother-sky,

Hearing us, thy loves, go by;

In the dawns when thou. shalt wake

To the toil thou canst not break,

Heartsick for the Jungle's sake;

Wood and Water, Wind air Tree,

Wisdom, Strength, and Courtesy,

Jungle-Favour go with thee!

Poem 188: Pagett, M.P.


The toad beneath the harrow knows

Exactly where each tooth-point goes.

The butterfly upon the road

Preaches contentment to that toad.



Pagett, M.P., was a liar, and a fluent liar therewith --

He spoke of the heat of India as the "Asian Solar Myth";

Came on a four months' visit, to "study the East," in November,

And I got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till September.


March came in with the koil. Pagett was cool and gay,

Called me a "bloated Brahmin," talked of my "princely pay."

March went out with the roses. "Where is your heat?" said he.

"Coming," said I to Pagett, "Skittles!" said Pagett, M.P.


April began with the punkah, coolies, and prickly-heat, --

Pagett was dear to mosquitoes, sandflies found him a treat.

He grew speckled and mumpy-hammered, I grieve to say,

Aryan brothers who fanned him, in an illiberal way.


May set in with a dust-storm, -- Pagett went down with the sun.

All the delights of the season tickled him one by one.

Imprimis -- ten day's "liver" -- due to his drinking beer;

Later, a dose of fever --slight, but he called it severe.


Dysent'ry touched him in June, after the Chota Bursat --

Lowered his portly person -- made him yearn to depart.

He didn't call me a "Brahmin," or "bloated," or "overpaid,"

But seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed.


July was a trifle unhealthy, -- Pagett was ill with fear.

'Called it the "Cholera Morbus," hinted that life was dear.

He babbled of "Eastern Exile," and mentioned his home with tears;

But I haven't seen my children for close upon seven years.


We reached a hundred and twenty once in the Court at noon,

(I've mentioned Pagett was portly) Pagett, went off in a swoon.

That was an end to the business; Pagett, the perjured, fled

With a practical, working knowledge of "Solar Myths" in his head.


And I laughed as I drove from the station, but the mirth died out on my lips

As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their "Eastern trips,"

And the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land,

And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand.

Poem 189: Parade-Song of the Camp-Animals


Elephants of the Gun-Teams


We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,        

The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees.

We bowed our necks to service--they ne'er were loosed again,--

Make way there, way for the ten-foot teams

       Of the Forty-Pounder train!



Gun-Bullocks


  Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,

  And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;

  Then we come into action and tug the guns again,--

  Make way there, way for the twenty yoke

           Of the Forty-Pounder train!



Cavalry Horses


     By the brand on my withers, the finest of tunes

     Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,

     And it's sweeter than "Stables" or "Water" to me,

     The Cavalry Canter of "Bonnie Dundee!"


     Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,

     And give us good riders and plenty of room,

     And launch us in column of squadron and see

     The Way  of the War-horse to "Bonnie Dundee!"



Screw-Gun Mules


As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,

The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;

For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, an  turn up everywhere  

And it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare!


Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road:

Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load!

For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,

And it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare!



Commissariat Camels


          We haven't a camelty tune of our own

          To help us trollop along,

          But every neck is a hair-trombone

          (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair-trombone! )

          And this is our marching-song:                  

          Can't! Don't! Shan't! Won't!

          Pass it along the line!

          Somebody's pack has slid from his back,

          'Wish it were only mine!

          Somebody's load has tipped off in the road--

          Cheer for a halt and a row!

          Urrr! Yarrh! Grr! Arrh!

          Somebody's catching it now!



All The Beasts Together


              Children of the Camp are we,

              Serving each in his degree;

              Children of the yoke and goad,

              Pack and harness, pad and load.

              See our line across the plain,

              Like a heel-rope bent again,

              Reaching, writhing, rolling far,

              Sweeping all away to war!

              While the men that walk beside,

              Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,

              Cannot tell why we or they

              March and suffer day by day.

                  Children of the Camp are we,

                   Serving each in his degree;

                   Children of the yoke and goad,

Poem 190: Pharaoh and the Sergeant


Said England unto Pharaoh, "I must make a man of you,

 That will stand upon his feet and play the game;

That will Maxim his oppressor as a Christian ought to do,"

 And she sent old Pharaoh Sergeant Whatisname.

   It was not a Duke nor Earl, nor yet a Viscount --

     It was not a big brass General that came;

   But a man in khaki kit who could handle men a bit,

     With his bedding labelled Sergeant Whatisname.


Said England unto Pharaoh,  "Though at present singing small,

 You shall hum a proper tune before it ends,"

And she introduced old Pharaoh to the Sergeant once for all,

 And left 'em in the desert making friends.

   It was not a Crystal Palace nor Cathedral;

     It was not a public-house of common fame;

   But a piece of red-hot sand, with a palm on either hand,

     And a little hut for Sergeant Whatisname.


Said England unto Pharaoh, "You 've had miracles before,

 When Aaron struck your rivers into blood;

But if you watch the Sergeant he can show you something more.                                   '

 He's a charm for making riflemen from mud."

   It was neither Hindustani, French, nor Coptics;

     It was odds and ends and leavings of the same,

   Translated by a stick (which is really half the trick),

     And Pharaoh harked to Sergeant Whatisname.


(There were y ears that no one talked of; there were times of horrid doubt --

 There was faith and hope and whacking and despair --

While the Sergeant gave the Cautions and he combed old Pharaoh out,

 And England didn't seem to know nor care.

   That is England's awful way o' doing business --

     She would serve her God (or Gordon) just the same --

   For she thinks her Empire still is the Strand and Hol born Hill,

     And she didn't think of Sergeant Whatisname.)


Said England to the Sergeant, "You can let my people go!"

  (England used 'em cheap and nasty from the start),

And they entered 'em in battle on a most astonished foe --

  But the Sergeant he had hardened Pharaoh's heart

    Which was broke, along of all the plagues of Egypt,

      Three thousand years before the Sergeant came

    And he mended it again in a little more than ten,

      Till Pharaoh fought like Sergeant Whatisname.


It was wicked bad campaigning (cheap and nasty from the first),

 There was heat and dust and coolie-work and sun,

There were vipers; flies, and sandstorms, there was cholera and thirst,

 But Pharaoh done the best he ever done.

   Down the desert, down the railway, down the river,

     Like Israelites From bondage so he came,

   'Tween the clouds o' dust and fire to the land of his desire,

     And his Moses, it was Sergeant Whatisname!


We are eating dirt in handfuls for to save our daily bread,

 Which we have to buy from those that hate us most,

And we must not raise the money where the Sergeant raised the dead,

 And it's wrong and bad and dangerous to boast.

   But he did it on the cheap and on the quiet,

   And he's not allowed to forward any claim --

 Though he drilled a black man white, though he made a mummy fight,

   He will still continue Sergeant Whatisname --

 Private, Corporal, Colour-Sergeant, and Instructor --

   But the everlasting miracle's the same!

Poem 191: Philadelphia


If you're off to Philadelphia in the morning,

 You mustn't take my stories for a guide.

There's little left, indeed, of the city you will read of,

 And all the folk I write about have died.

Now few will understand if you mention Talleyrand,

 Or remember what his cunning and his skill did;

And the cabmen at the wharf do not know Count Zinzendorf,

 Nor the Church in Philadelphia he builded.


   It is gone, gone, gone with lost Atlantis,

   (Never say I didn't give you warning).      

   In Seventeen Ninety-three 'twas there for all to see,

   But it's not in Philadelphia this morning.


If you're off to Philadelphia in the morning,

 You mustn't go by anything I've said.

Bob Bicknell's Southern Stages have been laid aside for ages,

 But the Limited will take you there instead.

Toby Hirte can't be seen at One Hundred and Eighteen

 North Second Street--no matter when you call;

And I fear you'll search in vain for the wash-house down the lane

 Where Pharaoh played the fiddle at the ball.


   It is gone, gone, gone with Thebes the Golden,

  (Never say I didn't give you warning).

   In Seventeen Ninety-four 'twas a famous dancing floor--

    But it's not in Philadelphia this morning.


If you're off to Philadelphia in the morning,

 You must telegraph for rooms at some Hotel.

You needn't try your luck at Epply's or "The Buck,"

 Though the Father of his Country liked them well.

It is not the slightest use to inquire for Adam Goos,

 Or to ask where Pastor Meder has removed--so

You must treat as out of date the story I relate

  Of the Church in Philadelphia he loved so.


     He is gone, gone, gone with Martin Luther

     (Never say I didn't give you warning)

     In Seventeen Ninety-five  he was, (rest his soul!) alive.

     But he's not in Philadelphia this morning.


If you're off to Philadelphia this morning,

  And wish to prove the truth of what I say,

I pledge my word you'll find the pleasant land behind

  Unaltered since Red Jacket rode that way.

Still  the  pine-woods  scent  the  noon;  still  the  catbird  sings  his

         tune;

  Still autumn sets the maple-forest blazing;

Still the  grape-vine through the  dusk  flings  her  soul-compelling

          musk;

  Still the fire-flies in the corn make night amazing!

  They are there, there, there with Earth immortal

  ( Citizens, I give you friendly warning )

  The thins that truly last when men and times have passed,

  They are all in Pennsylvania this morning!

Poem 194: Pink Dominoes


"They are fools who kiss and tell" --

 Wisely has the poet sung.

Man may hold all sorts of posts

 If he'll only hold his tongue.



Jenny and Me were engaged, you see,

 On the eve of the Fancy Ball;

So a kiss or two was nothing to you

 Or any one else at all.


Menny would go in a domino --

 Pretty and pink but warm;

While I attended, clad in a splendid

 Austrian uniform.


Now we had arranged, through notes exchanged

 Early that afternoon,

At Number Four to waltz no more,

 But to sit in the dusk and spoon.


I wish you to see that Jenny and Me

 Had barely exchanged our troth;

So a kiss or two was strictly due

 By, from, and between us both.


When Three was over, an eager lover,

 I fled to the gloom outside;

And a Domino came out also

 Whom I took for my future bride.


That is to say, in a casual way,

 I slipped my arm around her;

With a kiss or two (which is nothing to you),

 And ready to kiss I found her.


She turned her head and the name she said

 Was certainly not my own;

But ere I could speak, with a smothered shriek

 She fled and left me alone.


Then Jenny came, and I saw with shame

 She'd doffed her domino;

And I had embraced an alien waist --

 But I did not tell her so.


Next morn I knew that there were two

 Dominoes pink, and one

Had cloaked the spouse of Sir Julian Vouse,

 Our big Political gun.


Sir J. was old, and her hair was gold,

 And her eye was a blue cerulean;

And the name she said when she turned her head

 Was not in the least like "Julian."

Poem 195: Poor Honest Men


Your jar of Virginny

Will cost you a guinea,

Which you reckon too much by five shillings or ten;

But light your churchwarden

And judge it according,

When I've told you the troubles of poor honest men.


From the Capes of the Delaware,

As you are well aware,

We sail which tobacco for England-but then,

Our own British cruisers,

They watch us come through, sirs,

And they press half a score of us poor honest men!


Or if by quick sailing

(Thick weather prevailing )

We leave them behind ( as we do now and then)

We are sure of a gun from

Each frigate we run from,

Which is often destruction to poor honest men!


Broadsides the Atlantic

We tumble short-handed,

With shot-holes to plug and new canvas to bend;

And off the Azores,

Dutch, Dons and Monsieurs

Are waiting to terrify poor honest men.


Napoleon's embargo

Is laid on all cargo

Which comfort or aid to King George may intend;

And since roll, twist and leaf,

Of all comforts is chief,

They try for to steal it from poor honest men!

With no heart for fight,

We take refuge in flight,

But fire as we run, our retreat to defend;

Until our stern-chasers

Cut up her fore-braces,

And she flies off the wind from us poor honest men!


'Twix' the Forties and Fifties,

South-eastward the drift is,

And so, when we think we are making Land's End

Alas, it is Ushant                                    

With half the King's Navy

Blockading French ports against poor honest men!


But they may not quit station

(Which is our salvation )

So swiftly we stand to the Nor'ard again;

And finding the tail of

A homeward-bound convoy,    

We slip past the Scillies like poor honest men.


'Twix' the Lizard and Dover,

We hand our stuff over,

Though I may not inform how we do it, nor when.

But a light on each quarter,

Low down on the water,

Is well understanded by poor honest men.


Even then we have dangers,

From meddlesome strangers,

Who spy on our business and are not content

To take a smooth answer,

Except with a handspike  .  .  .

And they say they are murdered by poor honest men!


To be drowned or be shot

Is our natural lot,

Why should we, moreover, be hanged in the end---

After all our great pains

For to dangle in chains

As though we were smugglers, not poor honest men?

Poem 196: Poseidon's Law


When the robust and Brass-bound Man commissioned first for sea

His fragile raft, Poseidon laughed, and "Mariner," said he,

"Behold, a Law immutable I lay on thee and thine,

That never shall ye act or tell a falsehood at my shrine.


"Let Zeus adjudge your landward kin whose votive meal and sale

At easy-cheated altars win oblivion for the fault,

But you the unhoodwinked wave shall test--the immediate gulf condemn--

Except ye owe the Fates a jest, be slow to jest with them.


Ye shall not clear by Greekly speech, nor cozen from your path

The twinkling shoal, the leeward beach, or Hadria's white-lipped wrath;

Nor tempt with painted cloth for wood my fraud-avenging hosts;

Nor make at all, or all make good, your bulwarks and your boasts.


Now and henceforward serve unshod, through wet and wakeful shifts,

A present and oppressive God, but take, to aid, my gifts--

The wide and windward-opening eye, the large and lavish hand,

The soul that cannot tell a lie--except upon the land!"


In dromond and in catafract--wet, wakeful, windward-eyed--

He kept Poseidon's Law intact (his ship and freight beside),

But, once discharged the dromond's hold, the bireme beached once more,

Splendaciously mendacious rolled the Brass-bound Man ashore....


The thranite now and thalamite are pressures low and high,

And where three hundred blades bit white the twin-propellers ply.

The God that hailed, the keel that sailed are changed beyond recall,

But the robust and Brass-bound Man he is not changed at all!


From Punt returned, from Phormio's Fleet, from Javan and Gadire,

He strongly occupies the seat about the tavern fire,

And, moist with much Falernian or smoked Massilian juice,

Revenges there the Brass-bound Man his long-enforced truce!

Poem 197: Possibilities


Ay, lay him 'neath the Simla pine --

 A fortnight fully to be missed,

 Behold, we lose our fourth at whist,

A chair is vacant where we dine.


His place forgets him; other men

 Have bought his ponies, guns, and traps.

 His fortune is the Great Perhaps

And that cool rest-house down the glen,


Whence he shall hear, as spirits may,

 Our mundance revel on the height,

 Shall watch each flashing 'rickshaw-light

Sweep on to dinner, dance, and play.


Benmore shall woo him to the ball

 With lighted rooms and braying band;

 And he shall hear and understand

"Dream Faces" better than us all.


For, think you, as the vapours flee

 Across Sanjaolie after rain,

 His soul may climb the hill again

To each of field of victory.


Unseen, who women held so dear,

 The strong man's yearning to his kind

 Shall shake at most the window-blind,

Or dull awhile the card-room's cheer.


In his own place of power unkown,

 His Light o' Love another's flame,

And he and alien and alone!


Yet may he meet with many a friend --

 Shrewd shadows, lingering long unseen

 Among us when "God save the Queen"

Shows even "extras" have an end.


And, when we leave the heated room,

 And, when at four the lights expire,

 The crew shall gather round the fire

And mock our laughter in the gloom;


Talk as we talked, and they ere death --

 Flirt wanly, dance in ghostly-wise,

 With ghosts of tunes for melodies,

And vanish at the morning's breath.

Poem 198: Prelude


I have eaten your bread and salt.

I have drunk your water and wine.

In deaths ye died I have watched beside,

And the lives ye led were mine.


Was there aught that I did not share

In vigil or toil or ease, --

One joy or woe that I did not know,

Dear hearts across the seas?


I have written the tale of our life

For a sheltered people's mirth,

In jesting guise -- but ye are wise,

And ye know what the jest is worth.

Poem 199: Prophets at Home


Prophets have honour all over the Earth,

 Except in the village where they were born,

Where such as knew them boys from birth

 Nature-ally hold 'em in scorn.

When Prophets are naughty and young and vain,

 They make a won'erful grievance of it;

(You can see by their writings how they complain),

 But 0, 'tis won'erful good for the Prophet!


There's nothing Nineveh Town can give

 (Nor being swallowed by whales between),

Makes up for the place where a man's folk live,

 Which don't care nothing what he has been.

He might ha' been that, or he might ha' been this,

But they love and they hate him for what he is.

Poem 200: Public Waste


Walpole talks of "a man and his price."

List to a ditty queer --

The sale of a Deputy-Acting-Vice-

Resident-Engineer,

Bought like a bullock, hoof and hide,

By the Little Tin Gods on the Mountain Side.



By the Laws of the Family Circle 'tis written in letters of brass

That only a Colonel from Chatham can manage the Railways of State,

Because of the gold on his breeks, and the subjects wherein he must pass;

Because in all matters that deal not with Railways his knowledge is great.


Now Exeter Battleby Tring had laboured from boyhood to eld

On the Lines of the East and the West, and eke of the North and South;

Many Lines had he built and surveyed -- important the posts which he held;

And the Lords of the Iron Horse were dumb when he opened his mouth.


Black as the raven his garb, and his heresies jettier still --

Hinting that Railways required lifetimes of study and knowledge --

Never clanked sword by his side -- Vauban he knew not nor drill --

Nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the "College."


Wherefore the Little Tin Gods harried their little tin souls,

Seeing he came not from Chatham, jingled no spurs at his heels,

Knowing that, nevertheless, was he first on the Government rolls

For the billet of "Railway Instructor to Little Tin Gods on Wheels."


Letters not seldom they wrote him, "having the honour to state,"

It would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf.

Much would accrue to his bank-book, an he consented to wait

Until the Little Tin Gods built him a berth for himself,


"Special, well paid, and exempt from the Law of the Fifty and Five,

Even to Ninety and Nine" -- these were the terms of the pact:

Thus did the Little Tin Gods (lon may Their Highnesses thrive!)

Silence his mouth with rupees, keeping their Circle intact;


Appointing a Colonel from Chatham who managed the Bhamo State Line

(The wich was on mile and one furlong -- a guaranteed twenty-inch gauge),

So Exeter Battleby Tring consented his claims to resign,

And died, on four thousand a month, in the ninetieth year of his age!

Poem 201: Puck's Song


See you the ferny ride that steals

Into the oak-woods far?

O that was whence they hewed the keels

That rolled to Trafalgar.


And mark you where the ivy clings

To Bayham's mouldering walls?

O there we cast the stout railings

That stand around St. Paul's.


See you the dimpled track that runs

All hollow through the wheat?

O that was where they hauled the guns

That smote King Philip's fleet.


(Out of the Weald, the secret Weald,

Men sent in ancient years,

The horse-shoes red at Flodden Field,

The arrows at Poitiers!)


See you our little mill that clacks,

So busy by the brook?

She has ground her corn and paid her

Ever since Domesday Book.


See you our stilly woods of oak,

And the dread ditch beside?

O that was where the Saxons broke

On the day that Harold died.


See you the windy levels spread

About the gates of Rye?

O that was where the Northmen fled,

When Alfred's ships came by.


See you our pastures wide and lone,

Where the red oxen browse?

O there was a City thronged and known,

Ere London boasted a house.


And see you  after rain, the trace

Of mound and ditch and wall?

O that was a Legion's camping-place,

When Caesar sailed from Gaul.


And see you marks that show and fade,

Like shadows on the Downs?

O they are the lines the Flint Men made,

To guard their wondrous towns.


Trackway and Camp and City lost,

Salt Marsh where now is corn--

Old Wars, old Peace, old Arts that cease,

And so was England born!


She is not any common Earth,

Water or wood or air,

But Merlin's Isle of Gramarye,

Where you and I will fare!

 They sell their furs to the trading-post; they sell their souls to

 Their women have many ribbons, but their tents are torn and few.

In those lost lives we lived ere we were born--

What man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn?

           And the strict works of war--

             So long subdued

To sacrifice, that threadbare Death commands

Hardly observance at our busier hands.


          Yet we were what we were,

             And, fashioned so,

Of unbelievable years and shapes that flit,

In our own likeness, on the edge of it.

Poem 204: Recessional (A Victorian Ode)


God of our fathers, known of old --

 Lord of our far-flung battle line --

Beneath whose awful hand we hold

 Dominion over palm and pine --

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,

Lest we forget -- lest we forget!


The tumult and the shouting dies --

 The Captains and the Kings depart --

Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,

 An humble and a contrite heart.

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,

Lest we forget -- lest we forget!


Far-called our navies melt away --

 On dune and headland sinks the fire --

Lo, all our pomp of yesterday

 Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!

Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,

Lest we forget -- lest we forget!


If, drunk with sight of power, we loose

 Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe --

Such boastings as the Gentiles use,

 Or lesser breeds without the Law --

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,

Lest we forget -- lest we forget!


For heathen heart that puts her trust

 In reeking tube and iron shard --

All valiant dust that builds on dust,

 And guarding calls not Thee to guard.

For frantic boast and foolish word,

Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!

                             Amen.

Poem 208: Rimini


When I left Rome for Lalage's sake,

By the Legions' Road to Rimini,

She vowed her heart was mine to take

With me and my shield to Rimini--

(Till the Eagles flew from Rimini--)

And I've tramped Britain, and I've tramped Gaul

And the Pontic shore where the snow-flakes fall

As white as the neck of Lalage--

(As cold as the heart of Lalage!)

And I've lost Britain, and I've lost Gaul,

And I've lost Rome and, worst of all,

I've lost Lalage!


When you go by the Via Aurelia

As thousands have traveled before

Remember the Luck of the Soldier

Who never saw Rome any more!

Oh, dear was the sweetheart that kissed him,

And dear was the mother that bore;

But his shield was picked up in the heather,

And he never saw Rome any more!


And he left Rome, etc.


When you go by the Via Aurelia

That runs from the City to Gaul,

Remember the Luck of the Soldier

Who rose to be master of all!

He carried the sword and the buckler,

He mounted his guard on the Wall,

Till the Legions elected him Caesar,

And he rose to be master of all!


And he left Rome, etc.


It's twenty-five marches to Narbo,

It's forty-five more up the Rhone,

And the end may be death in the heather

Or life on an Emperor's throne.

But whether the Eagles obey us,

Or we go to the Ravens--alone,

I'd sooner be Lalage's lover

Than sit on an Emperor's throne!

Poem 209: Rimmon


Duly with knees that feign to quake--

 Bent head and shaded brow,--

Yet once again, for my father's sake,

 In Rimmon's House I bow.


The curtains part, the trumpet blares,

 And the eunuchs howl aloud;

And the gilt, swag-bellied idol glares

 Insolent over the crowd.


"This is Rimmon, Lord of the Earth--

 "Fear Him and bow the knee!"

And I watch my comrades hide their mirth

 That rode to the wars with me.


For we remember the sun and the sand

 And the rocks whereon we trod,

Ere we came to a scorched and a scornful land

 That did not know our God;


As we remember the sacrifice,

 Dead men an hundred laid--

Slain while they served His mysteries,

 And that He would not aid--


Not though we gashed ourselves and wept,

 For  the  high-priest  bade  us  wait;

Saying He went on a journey or slept,

 Or was drunk or had taken a mate.


(Praise ye Rimmon, King of Kings,

  Who ruleth Earth and Sky!

And again I bow as the censer swings

 And the God Enthroned goes by.)


Ay, we remember His sacred ark

 And the virtuous men that knelt

To the dark and the hush behind the dark

 Wherein we dreamed He dwelt;


Until we entered to hale Him out

 And found no more than an old

Uncleanly image girded about

 The loins with scarlet and gold.


Him we o'erset with the butts of our spears--

 Him and his vast designs--

To be scorn of our muleteers

 And the jest of our halted line.


By the picket-pins that the dogs defile,

 In the dung and the dust He lay,

Till the priests ran and chattered awhile

 And we wiped Him and took Him away.


Hushing the matter before it was known,

 They returned to our fathers afar,

And hastily set Him afresh on His throne

 Because he had won us the war.


Wherefore with knees that feign to quake--

 Bent head and shaded brow--

To this dog, for my father's sake,

 In the Rimmon's House I bow!

Oh, little did the Wolf-Child care--

 When first he planned his home,

What City should arise and bear

 The weight and state of Rome.


A shiftless, westward-wandering tramp,

 Checked by the Tiber flood,

He reared a wall around his camp

 Of uninspired mud.


But when his brother leaped the Wall

 And mocked its height and make,

He guessed the future of it all

 And slew him for its sake.


Swift was the blow--swift as the thought

 Which showed him in that hour

How unbelief may bring to naught

 The early steps of Power.


Foreseeing Time's imperilled hopes

 Of Glory, Grace, and Love--

All singers, Caesars, artists, Popes--

 Would fail if Remus throve,


He sent his brother to the Gods,

 And, when the fit was o'er,

Went on collecting turves and clods

 To build the Wall once more!

          that handles the dear little pets -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns -- the screw-guns they all love you!

    So when we call round with a few guns,

              o' course you will know what to do -- hoo! hoo!

    Jest send in your Chief an' surrender --

              it's worse if you fights or you runs:

    You can go where you please, you can skid up the trees,

              but you don't get away from the guns!


They sends us along where the roads are, but mostly we goes where they ain't:

We'd climb up the side of a sign-board an' trust to the stick o' the paint:

We've chivied the Naga an' Looshai, we've give the Afreedeeman fits,

For we fancies ourselves at two thousand,

          we guns that are built in two bits -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns . . .


If a man doesn't work, why, we drills 'im an' teaches 'im 'ow to behave;

If a beggar can't march, why, we kills 'im an' rattles 'im into 'is grave.

You've got to stand up to our business an' spring without snatchin' or fuss.

D'you say that you sweat with the field-guns?

          By God, you must lather with us -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns . . .


The eagles is screamin' around us, the river's a-moanin' below,

We're clear o' the pine an' the oak-scrub,

          we're out on the rocks an' the snow,

An' the wind is as thin as a whip-lash what carries away to the plains

The rattle an' stamp o' the lead-mules --

          the jinglety-jink o' the chains -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns . . .


There's a wheel on the Horns o' the Mornin',

          an' a wheel on the edge o' the Pit,

An' a drop into nothin' beneath you as straight as a beggar can spit:

With the sweat runnin' out o' your shirt-sleeves,

          an' the sun off the snow in your face,

An' 'arf o' the men on the drag-ropes

          to hold the old gun in 'er place -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns . . .


Smokin' my pipe on the mountings, sniffin' the mornin' cool,

I climbs in my old brown gaiters along o' my old brown mule.

The monkey can say what our road was --

          the wild-goat 'e knows where we passed.

Stand easy, you long-eared old darlin's!

          Out drag-ropes!  With shrapnel!  Hold fast -- 'Tss! 'Tss!

    For you all love the screw-guns -- the screw-guns they all love you!

    So when we take tea with a few guns,

              o' course you will know what to do -- hoo! hoo!

    Jest send in your Chief an' surrender --

              it's worse if you fights or you runs:

    You may hide in the caves, they'll be only your graves,

              but you can't get away from the guns!

Poem 216: Seal Lullaby


Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us

And black are the waters that sparkled so green.

The moon, O'er the combers, looks downward to find us

At rest in the hollows that rustle between.

Where billow meets billow, there soft by the pillow.

Oh, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!

The storm shall not wake thee, no shark overtake thee

Asleep in the storm of slow-swinging seas.

Poem 218: Sestina Of The Tramp-Royal


Speakin' in general, I 'ave tried 'em all,

The 'appy roads that take you o'er the world.

Speakin' in general, I 'ave found them good

For such as cannot use one bed too long,

But must get 'ence, the same as I 'ave done,

An' go observin' matters till they die.


What do it matter where or 'ow we die,

So long as we've our 'ealth to watch it all --

The different ways that different things are done,

An' men an' women lovin' in this world --

Takin' our chances as they come along,

An' when they ain't, pretendin' they are good?


In cash or credit -- no, it aren't no good;

You 'ave to 'ave the 'abit or you'd die,

Unless you lived your life but one day long,

Nor didn't prophesy nor fret at all,

But drew your tucker some'ow from the world,

An' never bothered what you might ha' done.


But, Gawd, what things are they I 'aven't done?

I've turned my 'and to most, an' turned it good,

In various situations round the world --

For 'im that doth not work must surely die;

But that's no reason man should labour all

'Is life on one same shift; life's none so long.


Therefore, from job to job I've moved along.

Pay couldn't 'old me when my time was done,

For something in my 'ead upset me all,

Till I 'ad dropped whatever 'twas for good,

An', out at sea, be'eld the dock-lights die,

An' met my mate -- the wind that tramps the world!


It's like a book, I think, this bloomin' world,

Which you can read and care for just so long,

But presently you feel that you will die

Unless you get the page you're readin' done,

An' turn another -- likely not so good;

But what you're after is to turn 'em all.


Gawd bless this world!  Whatever she 'ath done --

Excep' when awful long -- I've found it good.

So write, before I die, "'E liked it all!"

Poem 219: Seven Watchmen


Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower,

  Watching what had come upon mankind,

Showed the Man the Glory and the Power,

 And bade him shape the Kingdom to his mind.

"All things on Earth your will shall win you."

 ('Twas so their council ran)

" But the Kingdom--the Kingdom is within you,"

 Said the Man's own mind to the Man.

  For time--and some time--

As it was in the bitter years before

 So it shall be in the over-sweetened hour--

That a man's mind is wont to tell him more

 Than Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower.

Poem 220: Shillin' A Day


My name is O'Kelly, I've heard the Revelly

From Birr to Bareilly, from Leeds to Lahore,

Hong-Kong and Peshawur,

Lucknow and Etawah,

And fifty-five more all endin' in "pore".

Black Death and his quickness, the depth and the thickness,

Of sorrow and sickness I've known on my way,

But I'm old and I'm nervis,

I'm cast from the Service,

And all I deserve is a shillin' a day.

(~Chorus~)  Shillin' a day,

            Bloomin' good pay --

            Lucky to touch it, a shillin' a day!


Oh, it drives me half crazy to think of the days I

Went slap for the Ghazi, my sword at my side,

When we rode Hell-for-leather

Both squadrons together,

That didn't care whether we lived or we died.

But it's no use despairin', my wife must go charin'

An' me commissairin' the pay-bills to better,

So if me you be'old

In the wet and the cold,

By the Grand Metropold, won't you give me a letter?

(~Full chorus~)  Give 'im a letter --

                  'Can't do no better,

                  Late Troop-Sergeant-Major an' -- runs with a letter!

                  Think what 'e's been,

                  Think what 'e's seen,

Poem 221: Sir Richard's Song


I followed my Duke ere I was a lover,

   To take from England fief and fee;

 But now this game is the other way over--

   But now England hath taken me!


 I had my horse, my shield and banner,

   And a boy's heart, so whole and free;

 But now I sing in another manner--

   But now England hath taken me!


 As for my Father in his tower,

   Asking news of my ship at sea,

 He will remember his own hour--

   Tell him England hath taken me!


 As for my Mother in her bower,

   That rules my Father so cunningly,

 She will remember a maiden's power--

   Tell her England hath taken me!


 As for my Brother in Rouen City,

   A nimble and naughty' page is he,

 But he will come to suffer and pity--

   Tell him England hath taken me!


 As for my little Sister waiting

   In the pleasant orchards of Normandy,

 Tell her youth is the time for mating--

   Tell her England hath taken me!


 As for my comrades in camp and highway

   That lift their eyebrows scornfully,

 Tell them their way is not my way--

   Tell them England hath taken me!


 Kings and Princes and Barons famed,

   Knights and Captains in your degree;

 Hear me a little before I am blamed--

   Seeing England hath taken me!


 How so great man's strength be reckoned,

   There are two things he cannot flee.

 Love is the first, and Death is the second-

   And Love in England hath taken me!

Poem 222: Snarleyow


This 'appened in a battle to a batt'ry of the corps

Which is first among the women an' amazin' first in war;

An' what the bloomin' battle was I don't remember now,

But Two's off-lead 'e answered to the name o' ~Snarleyow~.

   Down in the Infantry, nobody cares;

   Down in the Cavalry, Colonel 'e swears;

   But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog

   Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog!


They was movin' into action, they was needed very sore,

To learn a little schoolin' to a native army corps,

They 'ad nipped against an uphill, they was tuckin' down the brow,

When a tricky, trundlin' roundshot give the knock to ~Snarleyow~.


They cut 'im loose an' left 'im -- 'e was almost tore in two --

But he tried to follow after as a well-trained 'orse should do;

'E went an' fouled the limber, an' the Driver's Brother squeals:

"Pull up, pull up for ~Snarleyow~ -- 'is head's between 'is 'eels!"


The Driver 'umped 'is shoulder, for the wheels was goin' round,

An' there ain't no "Stop, conductor!" when a batt'ry's changin' ground;

Sez 'e:  "I broke the beggar in, an' very sad I feels,

But I couldn't pull up, not for ~you~ -- your 'ead between your 'eels!"


'E 'adn't 'ardly spoke the word, before a droppin' shell

A little right the batt'ry an' between the sections fell;

An' when the smoke 'ad cleared away, before the limber wheels,

There lay the Driver's Brother with 'is 'ead between 'is 'eels.


Then sez the Driver's Brother, an' 'is words was very plain,

"For Gawd's own sake get over me, an' put me out o' pain."

They saw 'is wounds was mortial, an' they judged that it was best,

So they took an' drove the limber straight across 'is back an' chest.


The Driver 'e give nothin' 'cept a little coughin' grunt,

But 'e swung 'is 'orses 'andsome when it came to "Action Front!"

An' if one wheel was juicy, you may lay your Monday head

'Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread.


The moril of this story, it is plainly to be seen:

You 'avn't got no families when servin' of the Queen --

You 'avn't got no brothers, fathers, sisters, wives, or sons --

If you want to win your battles take an' work your bloomin' guns!

   Down in the Infantry, nobody cares;

   Down in the Cavalry, Colonel 'e swears;

   But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog

   Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog!

Poem 224: Song of the Fifth River


Where first by Eden Tree

The Four Great Rivers ran,

To each was appointed a Man

Her Prince and Ruler to be.


But after this was ordained

(The ancient legends' tell),

There came dark Israel,

For whom no River remained.


Then He Whom the Rivers obey

Said to him: "Fling on the ground

A handful of yellow clay,

And a Fifth Great River shall run,

Mightier than these Four,

In secret the  Earth around;

And Her secret evermore,

Shall be shown to thee and thy Race."


So it was said and done.

And, deep in the veins of Earth,

And, fed by a thousand springs

That comfort the market-place,

Or sap the power of King,

The Fifth Great River had birth,

Even as it was foretold--

The Secret River of Gold!


And Israel laid down

His sceptre and his crown,

To brood on that River bank

Where the waters flashed and sank

And burrowed in earth and fell

And bided a season below,

For reason that none might know,

Save only Israel


He is Lord of the Last--

The Fifth, most wonderful, Flood.

He hears Her thunder past

And Her Song is in his blood.

He can foresay: "She will fall,"

For he knows which fountain dries

Behind which desert-belt

A thousand leagues to the South.


He can foresay:  "She will rise."

He knows what far snows melt

Along what mountain-wall

A thousand leagues to the North,

He snuffs the coming drouth

As he snuffs the coming rain,

He knows what each will bring forth,

And turns it to his gain.


A Ruler without a Throne,

A Prince without a Sword,

Israel follows his quest.

In every land a guest,

Of many lands a lord,

In no land King is he.

But the Fifth Great River keeps

The secret of Her deeps

For Israel alone,

As it was ordered to be.

Poem 225: Song of the Galley Slaves


We pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails

    were low.

       Will you never let us go?

We ate bread and onions when you took towns, or ran aboard

    quickly when you were beaten back by the foe.

The Captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather sing-

    ing songs, but we were below.

We fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that

    we were idle, for we still swung to and fro.

       Will you never let us go?

The solt made the oar-hands like shark-skin; our knees were

    cut to the bone with salt-cracks; our hair was stuck to

    our foreheads; and our lips were cut to the gums, and you

    whipped us because we could not row.

       Will you never let us go?

But, in a little time, we shall run out of the port-holes as the water

    runs along the oar-blade,  and though you tell the others

    to row after us you will never catch us till you catch the

    oar-thresh and tie up the winds in the belly of the sail.

    Aho!

       Will you never let us go?

Poem 226: Tarrant Moss


I closed and drew for my love's sake

That now is false to me,

And I slew the Reiver of Tarrant Moss

And set Dumeny free.


They have gone down, they have gone down,

They are standing all arow -

Twenty knights in the peat-water,

That never struck a blow!


Their armour shall not dull nor rust,

Their flesh shall not decay,

For Tarrant Moss holds them in trust,

Until the Judgment Day.


Their soul went from them in their youth,

Ah God, that mine had gone,

Whenas I leaned on my love's truth

And not on my sword alone!


Whenas I leaned on lad's belief

And not on my naked blade -

And I slew a thief, and an honest thief,

For the sake of a worthless maid.


They have laid the Reiver low in his place,

They have set me up on high,

But the twenty knights in the peat-water

Are luckier than I!


And ever they give me gold and praise

And ever I mourn my loss -

For I struck the blow for my false love's sake

And not for the Men of the Moss!

Poem 227: That Day


It got beyond all orders an' it got beyond all 'ope;

It got to shammin' wounded an' retirin' from the 'alt.

'Ole companies was lookin' for the nearest road to slope;

It were just a bloomin' knock-out -- an' our fault!


    Now there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,

      Nor there ain't no band to play;

    An' I wish I was dead 'fore I done what I did,

      Or seen what I seed that day!


We was sick o' bein' punished, an' we let 'em know it, too;

An' a company-commander up an' 'it us with a sword,

An' some one shouted "'Ook it!" an' it come to ~sove-ki-poo~,

An' we chucked our rifles from us -- O my Gawd!


There was thirty dead an' wounded on the ground we wouldn't keep --

No, there wasn't more than twenty when the front begun to go;

But, Christ! along the line o' flight they cut us up like sheep,

An' that was all we gained by doin' so.


I 'eard the knives be'ind me, but I dursn't face my man,

Nor I don't know where I went to, 'cause I didn't 'alt to see,

Till I 'eard a beggar squealin' out for quarter as 'e ran,

An' I thought I knew the voice an' -- it was me!


We was 'idin' under bedsteads more than 'arf a march away;

We was lyin' up like rabbits all about the countryside;

An' the major cursed 'is Maker 'cause 'e lived to see that day,

An' the colonel broke 'is sword acrost, an' cried.


We was rotten 'fore we started -- we was never disci~plined~;

We made it out a favour if an order was obeyed;

Yes, every little drummer 'ad 'is rights an' wrongs to mind,

So we had to pay for teachin' -- an' we paid!


The papers 'id it 'andsome, but you know the Army knows;

We was put to groomin' camels till the regiments withdrew,

An' they gave us each a medal for subduin' England's foes,

An' I 'ope you like my song -- because it's true!


    An' there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,

      Nor there ain't no band to play;

    But I wish I was dead 'fore I done what I did,

Poem 228: The "Mary Gloster"


I've paid for your sickest fancies; I've humoured your crackedest whim --

Dick, it's your daddy, dying; you've got to listen to him!

Good for a fortnight, am I?  The doctor told you?  He lied.

I shall go under by morning, and --  Put that nurse outside.

'Never seen death yet, Dickie?  Well, now is your time to learn,

And you'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn.

Not counting the Line and the Foundry, the yards and the village, too,

I've made myself and a million; but I'm damned if I made you.

Master at two-and-twenty, and married at twenty-three --

Ten thousand men on the pay-roll, and forty freighters at sea!

Fifty years between 'em, and every year of it fight,

And now I'm Sir Anthony Gloster, dying, a baronite:

For I lunched with his Royal 'Ighness -- what was it the papers a-had?

"Not least of our merchant-princes."  Dickie, that's me, your dad!

~I~ didn't begin with askings.  ~I~ took my job and I stuck;

And I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck.

Lord, what boats I've handled -- rotten and leaky and old!

Ran 'em, or -- opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told.

Grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you grey,

And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way.

The others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life

(They've served me since as skippers).  ~I~ went, and I took my wife.

Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three,

And your mother saving the money and making a man of me.

~I~ was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;

She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind.

She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan,

When we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own.

Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how,

We started the Red Ox freighters -- we've eight-and-thirty now.

And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,

And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits --

By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank --

And we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank.

Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,

And she died in the ~Mary Gloster~.  My heart, how young we were!

So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore,

But your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more:

Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think,

Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink.

And I met M'Cullough in London (I'd turned five 'undred then),

And 'tween us we started the Foundry -- three forges and twenty men:

Cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns.  It paid, and the business grew,

For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too.

"Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em," ~I~ said, but M'Cullough he shied,

And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde.

And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,

Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square.

But M'Cullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,

And Brussels an' Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall,

And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light,

But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties, and --  Well, I'm dying to-night. . . .

I knew -- ~I~ knew what was coming, when we bid on the ~Byfleet~'s keel --

They piddled and piffled with iron:  I'd given my orders for steel!

Steel and the first expansions.  It paid, I tell you, it paid,

When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade!

And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text,

"You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!"

They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,

And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

Then came the armour-contracts, but that was M'Cullough's side;

He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died.

I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;

And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint.

(I remember his widow was angry.)  So I saw what the drawings meant,

And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent --

Sixty per cent ~with~ failures, and more than twice we could do,

And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you!

I thought -- it doesn't matter -- you seemed to favour your ma,

But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are.

Harrer an' Trinity College!  I ought to ha' sent you to sea --

But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?

The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,

And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live.

For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans,

And your rooms at college was beastly -- more like a whore's than a man's --

Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,

An' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?

I've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the Cromwell Road,

But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.

(So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.)

Not like your mother, she isn't.  ~She~ carried her freight each run.

But they died, the pore little beggars!  At sea she had 'em -- they died.

Only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside.

Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp

Nosing for scraps in the galley.  No help -- my son was no help!

So he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid.

I wouldn't give it you, Dickie -- you see, I made it in trade.

You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,

It all comes back to the business.  Gad, won't your wife be wild!

'Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye:

"Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" and doing her best to cry.

Grateful?  Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep her away from here.

Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer. . . .

There's women will say I've married a second time.

Not quite!  But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight.

She was the best o' the boiling -- you'll meet her before it ends;

I'm in for a row with the mother -- I'll leave you settle my friends:

For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand --

Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand.

But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still --

I'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will.

Here!  Take your hand off the bell-pull.  Five thousand's waiting for you,

If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do.

They'll try to prove me crazy, and, if you bungle, they can;

And I've only you to trust to!  (O God, why ain't he a man?)

There's some waste money on marbles, the same as M'Cullough tried --

Marbles and mausoleums -- but I call that sinful pride.

There's some ship bodies for burial -- we've carried 'em, soldered and packed;

Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called ~them~ cracked.

But me -- I've too much money, and people might. . . .  All my fault:

It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault.

I'm sick o' the 'ole dam' business; I'm going back where I came.

Dick, you're the son o' my body, and you'll take charge o' the same!

I want to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away,

And they'll want to send me to Woking; and that's where you'll earn your pay.

I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done --

Quiet, and decent, and proper -- an' here's your orders, my son.

You know the Line?  You don't, though.  You write to the Board, and tell

Your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a spell,

An' you'd like the ~Mary Gloster~ -- I've held her ready for this --

They'll put her in working order and you'll take her out as she is.

Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside

(Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!) -- the boat where your mother died,

By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank,

We dropped her -- I think I told you -- and I pricked it off where she sank --

['Tiny she looked on the grating -- that oily, treacly sea --]

'Hundred and eighteen East, remember, and South just three.

Easy bearings to carry -- three South -- three to the dot;

But I gave M'Andrew a copy in case of dying -- or not.

And so you'll write to M'Andrew, he's Chief of the Maori Line;

They'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine.

I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were,

An' I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me -- and her.

After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep

Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep;

For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend,

I've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end.

Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar, I've heard he's prayed for my soul,

But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole!

He'll take the ~Mary~ in ballast -- you'll find her a lively ship;

And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on 'is wedding-trip,

Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide,

The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside!

Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage -- our 'ouse-flag flyin' free --

Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea!

He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show,

And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go --

By the heel of the Paternosters -- there isn't a chance to mistake --

And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break!

Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the staunchest freighter afloat,

And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat!

He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone;

He knows what I want o' the ~Mary~. . . .  I'll do what I please with my own.

Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more;

I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door. . . .

For my son 'e was never a credit:  'e muddled with books and art,

And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart.

There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done --

The only one you left me, O mother, the only one!

Harrer and Trinity College -- me slavin' early an' late --

An' he thinks I'm dying crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait!

Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen,

That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then,

But -- cheap repairs for a cheap 'un -- the doctors said I'd do:

Mary, why didn't ~you~ warn me?  I've allus heeded to you,

Excep' -- I know -- about women; but you are a spirit now;

An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man.  That's how.

An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand;

But I never talked 'em secrets.  I paid 'em out o' hand.

Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies!  Now what's five thousand to me,

For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be?

~I~ believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain,

But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again.

For the heart it shall go with the treasure -- go down to the sea in ships.

I'm sick of the hired women -- I'll kiss my girl on her lips!

I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well,

And the wife of my youth shall charm me -- an' the rest can go to Hell!

(Dickie, ~he~ will, that's certain.)  I'll lie in our standin'-bed,

An' Mac'll take her in ballast -- an' she trims best by the head. . . .

Down by the head an' sinkin', her fires are drawn and cold,

And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold --

Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark --

Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady.  Hark!

That was the after-bulkhead. . . .  She's flooded from stem to stern. . . .

Never seen death yet, Dickie? . . .  Well, now is your time to learn!

Poem 229: The 'Eathen


The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;

'E don't obey no orders unless they is 'is own;

'E keeps 'is side-arms awful:  'e leaves 'em all about,

An' then comes up the regiment an' pokes the 'eathen out.


    All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,

    All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less,

    All along of abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho, *

    Mind you keep your rifle an' yourself jus' so!


* abby-nay:  Not now.  kul:  To-morrow.  hazar-ho:  Wait a bit.


The young recruit is 'aughty -- 'e draf's from Gawd knows where;

They bid 'im show 'is stockin's an' lay 'is mattress square;

'E calls it bloomin' nonsense -- 'e doesn't know no more --

An' then up comes 'is Company an' kicks 'im round the floor!


The young recruit is 'ammered -- 'e takes it very 'ard;

'E 'angs 'is 'ead an' mutters -- 'e sulks about the yard;

'E talks o' "cruel tyrants" 'e'll swing for by-an'-by,

An' the others 'ears an' mocks 'im, an' the boy goes orf to cry.


The young recruit is silly -- 'e thinks o' suicide;

'E's lost 'is gutter-devil; 'e 'asn't got 'is pride;

But day by day they kicks 'im, which 'elps 'im on a bit,

Till 'e finds 'isself one mornin' with a full an' proper kit.


    Gettin' clear o' dirtiness, gettin' done with mess,

    Gettin' shut o' doin' things rather-more-or-less;

    Not so fond of abby-nay, kul, nor hazar-ho,

    Learns to keep 'is rifle an' 'isself jus' so!


The young recruit is 'appy -- 'e throws a chest to suit;

You see 'im grow mustaches; you 'ear 'im slap 'is boot;

'E learns to drop the "bloodies" from every word 'e slings,

An' 'e shows an 'ealthy brisket when 'e strips for bars an' rings.


The cruel-tyrant-sergeants they watch 'im 'arf a year;

They watch 'im with 'is comrades, they watch 'im with 'is beer;

They watch 'im with the women at the regimental dance,

And the cruel-tyrant-sergeants send 'is name along for "Lance".


An' now 'e's 'arf o' nothin', an' all a private yet,

'Is room they up an' rags 'im to see what they will get;

They rags 'im low an' cunnin', each dirty trick they can,

But 'e learns to sweat 'is temper an' 'e learns to sweat 'is man.


An', last, a Colour-Sergeant, as such to be obeyed,

'E schools 'is men at cricket, 'e tells 'em on parade;

They sees 'em quick an' 'andy, uncommon set an' smart,

An' so 'e talks to orficers which 'ave the Core at 'eart.


'E learns to do 'is watchin' without it showin' plain;

'E learns to save a dummy, an' shove 'im straight again;

'E learns to check a ranker that's buyin' leave to shirk;

An' 'e learns to make men like 'im so they'll learn to like their work.


An' when it comes to marchin' he'll see their socks are right,

An' when it comes to action 'e shows 'em 'ow to sight;

'E knows their ways of thinkin' and just what's in their mind;

'E knows when they are takin' on an' when they've fell be'ind.


'E knows each talkin' corpril that leads a squad astray;

'E feels 'is innards 'eavin', 'is bowels givin' way;

'E sees the blue-white faces all tryin' 'ard to grin,

An' 'e stands an' waits an' suffers till it's time to cap 'em in.


An' now the hugly bullets come peckin' through the dust,

An' no one wants to face 'em, but every beggar must;

So, like a man in irons which isn't glad to go,

They moves 'em off by companies uncommon stiff an' slow.


Of all 'is five years' schoolin' they don't remember much

Excep' the not retreatin', the step an' keepin' touch.

It looks like teachin' wasted when they duck an' spread an' 'op,

But if 'e 'adn't learned 'em they'd be all about the shop!


An' now it's "'Oo goes backward?" an' now it's "'Oo comes on?"

And now it's "Get the doolies," an' now the captain's gone;

An' now it's bloody murder, but all the while they 'ear

'Is voice, the same as barrick drill, a-shepherdin' the rear.


'E's just as sick as they are, 'is 'eart is like to split,

But 'e works 'em, works 'em, works 'em till he feels 'em take the bit;

The rest is 'oldin' steady till the watchful bugles play,

An' 'e lifts 'em, lifts 'em, lifts 'em through the charge that wins the day!


    The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;

    'E don't obey no orders unless they is 'is own;

    The 'eathen in 'is blindness must end where 'e began,

    But the backbone of the Army is the non-commissioned man!


    Keep away from dirtiness -- keep away from mess.

    Don't get into doin' things rather-more-or-less!

    Let's ha' done with abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho;

    Mind you keep your rifle an' yourself jus' so!

Poem 230: The Absent-Minded Beggar


When you've shouted " Rule Britannia," when you've sung " God save the Queen,"

When you've finished killing Kruger with your mouth,

Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little tambourine

For a gentleman in khaki ordered South?

He's an absent-minded beggar, and his weaknesses are great -

But we and Paul must take him as we find him -

He is out on active service, wiping something off a slate

And he's left a lot of little things behind him!

Duke's son - cook's son - son of a hundred kings

(Fifty thousand horse and foot going to Table Bay!)

Each of 'em doing his country's work

(and who's to look after their things?)

Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay - pay - pay !

There are girls he married secret, asking no permission to,

For he knew he wouldn't get it if he did.

There is gas and coals and vittles, and the house-rent falling due,

And its more than rather likely there’s a kid.

There are girls he’s walked with casual. They’ll be sorry now he’s gone,

For an absent-minded beggar they will find him,

But it ain’t the time for sermons with the winter coming on

We must help the girl that Tommy’s left behind him!

Cook's son - Duke's son - son of a belted Earl

Son of a Lambeth publican - it's all the same to-day !

Each of 'em doing his country's work

(and who's to look after the girl?)

Pass the hat for your credit's sake, J1 and pay - pay - pay !


There are families by thousands, far too proud to beg or speak,

And they'll put their sticks and bedding up the spout,

And they'll live on half o' nothing, paid 'em punctual once a week,

'Cause the man that earns the wage is ordered out.

He's an absent-minded beggar, but he heard his country call,

And his reg'rnent didn't need to send to find him!

He chucked his job and joined it - so the job before us all

Is to help the home that Tommy's left behind him !

Duke's job - cook's job - gardener, baronet, groom.

Mews or palace or paper-shop, there's someone gone away!

Each of 'em doing his country's work

(and who's to look after the room?)

Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay - pay - pay !


Let us manage so as, later, we can look him in the face,

And tell him - what he'd very much prefer

That, while he saved the Empire, his employer saved his place,

And his mates (that's you and me) looked out for her.

He's an absent-minded beggar and he may forget it all,

But we do not want his kiddies to remind him

That we sent 'em to the workhouse while their daddy hammered Paul,

So we'll help the homes that Tommy left behind him !

Cook's home - Duke's home - home of a millionaire,

(Fifty thousand horse and foot going to Table Bay !)

Each of 'em doing his country's work

(and what have you got to spare?)

Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay - pay - pay!

Poem 231: The Advertisement


Whether to wend through straight streets strictly,

Trimly by towns perfectly paved;

Or after office, as fitteth thy fancy,

Faring with friends far among fields;

There is none other equal in action,

Sith she  is silent,  nimble,  unnoisome,

Lordly of leather, gaudily gilded,

Burgeoning brightly in a brass bonnet,

Certain to steer well between wains.

Poem 232: The American Rebellion


BEFORE


'Twas not while England's sword unsheathed

   Put half a world to flight,

Nor while their new-built cities breathed

   Secure behind her might;

Not while she poured from Pole to Line

   Treasure and ships and men—

These worshippers at Freedom's shrine

   They did not quit her then!


Not till their foes were driven forth

   By England o'er the main—

Not till the Frenchman from the North

   Had gone with shattered Spain;

Not till the clean-swept oceans showed

   No hostile flag unrolled,

Did they remember what they owed

   To Freedom—and were bold!



AFTER


The snow lies thick on Valley Forge,

   The ice on the Delaware,

But the poor dead soldiers of King George

   They neither know nor care—


Not though the earliest primrose break

   On the sunny side of the lane,

And scuffling rookeries awake

   Their England's spring again.


They will not stir when the drifts are gone

   Or the ice melts out of the bay:

And the men that served with Washington

   Lie all as still as they.


They will not stir though the mayflower blows

   In the moist dark woods of pine,

And every rock-strewn pasture shows

   Mullein and columbine.


Each for his land, in a fair fight,

   Encountered, strove, and died,

And the kindly earth that knows no spite

   Covers them side by side.


She is too busy to think of war;

   She has all the world to make gay;

And, behold, the yearly flowers are,

   Where they were in our fathers' day!


Golden-rod by the pasture-wall

   When the columbine is dead,

And sumach leaves that turn, in fall,

   Bright as the blood they shed.

Poem 233: The Answer


A Rose, in tatters on the garden path,

Cried out to God and murmured 'gainst His Wrath,

Because a sudden wind at twilight's hush

Had snapped her stem alone of all the bush.

And God, Who hears both sun-dried dust and sun,

Had pity, whispering to that luckless one,

"Sister, in that thou sayest We did not well --

What voices heardst thou when thy petals fell?"

And the Rose answered, "In that evil hour

A voice said, `Father, wherefore falls the flower?

For lo, the very gossamers are still.'

And a voice answered, `Son, by Allah's will!'"


Then softly as a rain-mist on the sward,

Came to the Rose the Answer of the Lord:

"Sister, before We smote the dark in twain,

Ere yet the stars saw one another plain,

Time, Tide, and Space, We bound unto the task

That thou shouldst fall, and such an one should ask."

Whereat the withered flower, all content,

Died as they die whose days are innocent;

While he who questioned why the flower fell

Caught hold of God and saved his soul from Hell.

There shall be one people--it shall serve one Lord--

Poem 236: The Ballad of Ahmed Shah


This is the ballad of Ahmed Shah

Dealer in tats in the Sudder Bazar,

By the gate that leads to the Gold Minar

How he was done by a youth from Morar.


Ahmed Shah was a man of peace -

His beard and turban were thick with grease:

His paunch was huge and his speech was slow

And he swindled the subalterns high and low,

Scores of subalterns came to try

The tats that he sold - and remained to buy,

Scores of subalterns later on

Found that their flashiest mounts were 'gone' -

Some in the front and some behind

Some were roarers and some went blind -

Scores of subalterns over their 'weeds'

Cursed old Ahmed and all his deeds.

But Ahmed Shah in his gully sat still -

And ever he fashioned a Little Black Pill!


Yet a judgement was brewing for Ahmed Shah,

Like a witches cauldron, in far Morar

And the youth that brewed it has eyes of blue

And his cheek was beardless and boundless too.

Softly he mused o'er a trichi thick:-

'By the Beard of the Prophet I've got the trick!'

Then he rose from his chair with an artless grin

And called the Battery Sergeant in:-

'Sergeant' he said 'Hasst aught for me

In the way of a "caster" with lots of gee ?'

The sergeant pondered and answered slow

'There's a red-roan gelding that's bound to go

At the next Committee. 'E ain't no use

Excep' for kickin' recruits to the deuce,

'E's chained in the sick lines.'

The subaltern's brow

Was puckered with thought for a moment. Then

The sergeant was richer by rupees ten.

'When the next Committee sits' quoth he

'O Sergeant buy up that brute for me.'


So the plot was laid and the long weeks passed

And the red-road gelding was duly cast.

They led him in chains to the subaltern's stall

And gave him his gram' through a hole in the wall.

The subaltern mixed it. When morning came

The red-road gelding was strangely tame.

He bit not nor kicked nor essayed to slay

And he and the sub went north that day

Till they came to the gully of Ahmed Shah

The man and the horse from far Morar.

The subaltern stated his funds were low

And he came - mehrbani - to 'sell karo'.

Then Ahmed Shah with his eyes agog

Broke the Tenth Command in the decalogue,

For the roan was a monster in size and thews

And stood over sixteen hand in his shoes.

'Sahib kitna mangta?' With brow serene

The subaltern softly answered 'Teen'.

He haggled an hour, that dealer thrifty

Till the price was lowered to do sow fifty

And the money was paid in greasy rupees

While the red-roan gelding drowsed at his ease.

The subaltern left him - and Ahmed smiled -

'By Allah, how mad is this pink-faced child

I will stuff that ghorah with attah and goor

And sell him again to some English soor

For a clear eight-fifty!" ... and e'en as he spoke

The devil they'd drugged in the red-roan woke !

Then the head-ropes snapped and the heel-ropes drew

And the stallions squealed as the roan went through

And the syces ran as men run for life

And the yard was troubled with equine strife

Till the berserk-rage of the beat was o'er

And he dropped to slumber at Ahmed's door!


Then a veil was lifted from Ahmed's eyes

And he raised the eyelids and punched the thighs

Felt the tense pulse slacken - the muscles still -

And fathomed the Trcik of the Opium Pill!

His own old dodge that had brought him pelf

Had the subaltern turned against himself!


Did he swear, though his three best tats were lame

And half of the city would hear of his shame ?

Did he seek the law courts? With downcast eye

He hailed an ekka that jingled by,

And drove to the station, where filled with peace

The subaltern counted the greasy rupees.


What passed between them? I cannot say,

The subaltern turns the question away

With an innocent laugh: but the men of Morar

Say he still gets ponies from Ahmed Shah.

Ponies to bet on - but not to buy -

Weeds to look at but devils to fly

And once in a while comes a tiny pill-box.

The Doctor abets him...Whenever I'm able

I plunge to my last clean shirt on their stable!

Poem 237: The Ballad Of Boh Da Thone


This is the ballad of Boh Da Thone,

          Erst a Pretender to Theebaw's throne,

          Who harried the district of Alalone:

          How he met with his fate and the V.P.P.*

          At the hand of Harendra Mukerji,

          Senior Gomashta, G.B.T.


* Value Payable Parcels Post:  in which the Government collects the money

for the sender.


Boh Da Thone was a warrior bold:

His sword and his Snider were bossed with gold,


And the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore

Was stiff with bullion, but stiffer with gore.


He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak

From the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak:


He crucified noble, he sacrificed mean,

He filled old ladies with kerosene:


While over the water the papers cried,

"The patriot fights for his countryside!"


But little they cared for the Native Press,

The worn white soldiers in Khaki dress,


Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre,

Who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire,


Who gave up their lives, at the Queen's Command,

For the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land.


Now, first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone

Was Captain O'Neil of the "Black Tyrone",


And his was a Company, seventy strong,

Who hustled that dissolute Chief along.


There were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath

Who went to their death with a joke in their teeth,


And worshipped with fluency, fervour, and zeal

The mud on the boot-heels of "Crook" O'Neil.


But ever a blight on their labours lay,

And ever their quarry would vanish away,


Till the sun-dried boys of the Black Tyrone

Took a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone:


And, sooth, if pursuit in possession ends,

The Boh and his trackers were best of friends.


The word of a scout -- a march by night --

A rush through the mist -- a scattering fight --


A volley from cover -- a corpse in the clearing --

The glimpse of a loin-cloth and heavy jade earring --


The flare of a village -- the tally of slain --

And. . .the Boh was abroad "on the raid" again!


They cursed their luck, as the Irish will,

They gave him credit for cunning and skill,


They buried their dead, they bolted their beef,

And started anew on the track of the thief


Till, in place of the "Kalends of Greece", men said,

"When Crook and his darlings come back with the head."


They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain --

He doubled and broke for the hills again:


They had crippled his power for rapine and raid,

They had routed him out of his pet stockade,


And at last, they came, when the Day Star tired,

To a camp deserted -- a village fired.


A black cross blistered the Morning-gold,

And the body upon it was stark and cold.


The wind of the dawn went merrily past,

The high grass bowed her plumes to the blast.


And out of the grass, on a sudden, broke

A spirtle of fire, a whorl of smoke --


And Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone

Was blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone --

The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone.


(Now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire

Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire.)


    .    .    .    .    .


The shot-wound festered -- as shot-wounds may

In a steaming barrack at Mandalay.


The left arm throbbed, and the Captain swore,

"I'd like to be after the Boh once more!"


The fever held him -- the Captain said,

"I'd give a hundred to look at his head!"


The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred,

But Babu Harendra (Gomashta) heard.


He thought of the cane-brake, green and dank,

That girdled his home by the Dacca tank.


He thought of his wife and his High School son,

He thought -- but abandoned the thought -- of a gun.


His sleep was broken by visions dread

Of a shining Boh with a silver head.


He kept his counsel and went his way,

And swindled the cartmen of half their pay.


    .    .    .    .    .


And the months went on, as the worst must do,

And the Boh returned to the raid anew.


But the Captain had quitted the long-drawn strife,

And in far Simoorie had taken a wife.


And she was a damsel of delicate mould,

With hair like the sunshine and heart of gold,


And little she knew the arms that embraced

Had cloven a man from the brow to the waist:


And little she knew that the loving lips

Had ordered a quivering life's eclipse,


And the eye that lit at her lightest breath

Had glared unawed in the Gates of Death.


(For these be matters a man would hide,

As a general rule, from an innocent Bride.)


And little the Captain thought of the past,

And, of all men, Babu Harendra last.


    .    .    .    .    .


But slow, in the sludge of the Kathun road,

The Government Bullock Train toted its load.


Speckless and spotless and shining with ~ghee~,

In the rearmost cart sat the Babu-jee.


And ever a phantom before him fled

Of a scowling Boh with a silver head.


Then the lead-cart stuck, though the coolies slaved,

And the cartmen flogged and the escort raved;


And out of the jungle, with yells and squeals,

Pranced Boh Da Thone, and his gang at his heels!


Then belching blunderbuss answered back

The Snider's snarl and the carbine's crack,


And the blithe revolver began to sing

To the blade that twanged on the locking-ring,


And the brown flesh blued where the bay'net kissed,

As the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist,


And the great white bullocks with onyx eyes

Watched the souls of the dead arise,


And over the smoke of the fusillade

The Peacock Banner staggered and swayed.


Oh, gayest of scrimmages man may see

Is a well-worked rush on the G.B.T.!


The Babu shook at the horrible sight,

And girded his ponderous loins for flight,


But Fate had ordained that the Boh should start

On a lone-hand raid of the rearmost cart,


And out of that cart, with a bellow of woe,

The Babu fell -- flat on the top of the Boh!


For years had Harendra served the State,

To the growth of his purse and the girth of his ~p]^et~.


There were twenty stone, as the tally-man knows,

On the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs.


And twenty stone from a height discharged

Are bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged.


Oh, short was the struggle -- severe was the shock --

He dropped like a bullock -- he lay like a block;


And the Babu above him, convulsed with fear,

Heard the labouring life-breath hissed out in his ear.


And thus in a fashion undignified

The princely pest of the Chindwin died.


    .    .    .    .    .


Turn now to Simoorie where, lapped in his ease,

The Captain is petting the Bride on his knees,


Where the ~whit~ of the bullet, the wounded man's scream

Are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream --


Forgotten, forgotten the sweat of the shambles

Where the hill-daisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols,


From the sword-belt set free and released from the steel,

The Peace of the Lord is with Captain O'Neil.


    .    .    .    .    .


Up the hill to Simoorie -- most patient of drudges --

The bags on his shoulder, the mail-runner trudges.


"For Captain O'Neil, ~Sahib~.  One hundred and ten

Rupees to collect on delivery."

                                Then


(Their breakfast was stopped while the screw-jack and hammer

Tore waxcloth, split teak-wood, and chipped out the dammer;)


Open-eyed, open-mouthed, on the napery's snow,

With a crash and a thud, rolled -- the Head of the Boh!


And gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran: --

              "IN FIELDING FORCE SERVICE.

                    ~Encampment~,

th Jan.


"Dear Sir, -- I have honour to send, ~as you said~,

For final approval (see under) Boh's Head;


"Was took by myself in most bloody affair.

By High Education brought pressure to bear.


"Now violate Liberty, time being bad,

To mail V.P.P. (rupees hundred)  Please add


"Whatever Your Honour can pass.  Price of Blood

Much cheap at one hundred, and children want food;


"So trusting Your Honour will somewhat retain

True love and affection for Govt. Bullock Train,


"And show awful kindness to satisfy me,

        I am,

            Graceful Master,

                          Your

                            H. MUKERJI."


    .    .    .    .    .


As the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnake's power,

As the smoker's eye fills at the opium hour,


As a horse reaches up to the manger above,

As the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love,


From the arms of the Bride, iron-visaged and slow,

The Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh.


And e'en as he looked on the Thing where It lay

'Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins' array,


The freed mind fled back to the long-ago days --

The hand-to-hand scuffle -- the smoke and the blaze --


The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn --

The banjo at twilight, the burial ere morn --


The stench of the marshes -- the raw, piercing smell

When the overhand stabbing-cut silenced the yell --


The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood

Where the black crosses hung o'er the Kuttamow flood.


As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide

The Captain went out on the Past from his Bride,


Back, back, through the springs to the chill of the year,

When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer.


As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water,

In his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter,


And men who had fought with O'Neil for the life

Had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife.


For she who had held him so long could not hold him --

Though a four-month Eternity should have controlled him --


But watched the twin Terror -- the head turned to head --

The scowling, scarred Black, and the flushed savage Red --


The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to

Some grim hidden Past she had never a clue to.


But It knew as It grinned, for he touched it unfearing,

And muttered aloud, "So you kept that jade earring!"


Then nodded, and kindly, as friend nods to friend,

"Old man, you fought well, but you lost in the end."


    .    .    .    .    .


The visions departed, and Shame followed Passion: --

"He took what I said in this horrible fashion,


"~I'll~ write to Harendra!"  With language unsainted

The Captain came back to the Bride. . .who had fainted.


    .    .    .    .    .


And this is a fiction?  No.  Go to Simoorie

And look at their baby, a twelve-month old Houri,


A pert little, Irish-eyed Kathleen Mavournin --

She's always about on the Mall of a mornin' --


And you'll see, if her right shoulder-strap is displaced,

This:  ~Gules~ upon ~argent~, a Boh's Head, ~erased!~

Poem 238: The Ballad of Bolivar


Seven men from all the world back to Docks again,

Rolling down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain:

Give the girls another drink 'fore we sign away --

We that took the BOLIVAR out across the Bay!


We put out from Sunderland loaded down with rails;

We put back to Sunderland 'cause our cargo shifted;

We put out from Sunderland -- met the winter gales --

Seven days and seven nights to The Start we drifted.

   Racketing her rivets loose, smoke-stack white as snow,

   All the coals adrift adeck, half the rails below,

   Leaking like a lobster-pot, steering like a dray --

   Out we took the Bolivar, out across the Bay!


One by one the Lights came up, winked and let us by;

Mile by mile we waddled on, coal and fo'c'sle short;

Met a blow that laid us down, heard a bulkhead fly;

Left the Wolf behind us with a two-foot list to port.

   Trailing like a wounded duck, working out her soul;

   Clanging like a smithy-shop after every roll;

   Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray --

   So we threshed the Bolivar out across the Bay!


'Felt her hog and felt her sag, betted when she'd break;

Wondered every time she raced if she'd stand the shock;

Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake;

Hoped the Lord 'ud keep His thumb on the plummer-block.

   Banged against the iron decks, bilges choked with coal;

   Flayed and frozen foot and hand, sick of heart and soul;

   'Last we prayed she'd buck herself into judgment Day --

   Hi! we cursed the Bolivar knocking round the Bay!


O her nose flung up to sky, groaning to be still --

Up and down and back we went, never time for breath;

Then the money paid at Lloyds' caught her by the heel,

And the stars ran round and round dancin' at our death!

   Aching for an hour's sleep, dozing off between;

   'Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green;

   'Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play --

   That was on the Bolivar, south across the Bay!


Once we saw between the squalls, lyin' head to swell --

Mad with work and weariness, wishin' they was we --

Some damned Liner's lights go by like a grand hotel;

Cheered her from the Bolivar swampin' in the sea.

   Then a greybeard cleared us out, then the skipper laughed;

   "Boys, the wheel has gone to Hell -- rig the winches aft!

   Yoke the kicking rudder-head -- get her under way!"

   So we steered her, pully-haul, out across the Bay!


Just a pack o' rotten plates puttied up with tar,

In we came, an' time enough, 'cross Bilbao Bar.

   Overloaded, undermanned, meant to founder, we

   Euchred God Almighty's storm, bluffed the Eternal Sea!


Seven men from all the world back to town again,

Rollin' down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain:

Seven men from out of Hell.  Ain't the owners gay,

'Cause we took the "Bolivar" safe across the Bay?

Poem 239: The Ballad Of East And West


Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,

    Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;

    But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,

    When two strong men stand face to face,

      tho' they come from the ends of the earth!


Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,

And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:

He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,

And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.

Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:

"Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?"

Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:

"If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.

At dusk he harries the Abazai -- at dawn he is into Bonair,

But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,

So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,

By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai.

But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,

For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.

There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,

And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen."

The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,

With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell

  and the head of the gallows-tree.

The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat --

Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.

He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,

Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,

Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,

And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.

He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.

"Ye shoot like a soldier," Kamal said.  "Show now if ye can ride."

It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dustdevils go,

The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.

The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,

But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.

There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,

And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.

They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,

The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.

The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,

And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.

He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,

"'Twas only by favour of mine," quoth he, "ye rode so long alive:

There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,

But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.

If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,

The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:

If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,

The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly."

Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  "Do good to bird and beast,

But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.

If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,

Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.

They will feed their horse on the standing crop,

  their men on the garnered grain,

The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.

But if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,

The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!

And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,

Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!"

Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.

"No talk shall be of dogs," said he, "when wolf and gray wolf meet.

May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;

What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?"

Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  "I hold by the blood of my clan:

Take up the mare for my father's gift -- by God, she has carried a man!"

The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;

"We be two strong men," said Kamal then, "but she loveth the younger best.

So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,

My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain."

The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,

"Ye have taken the one from a foe," said he;

  "will ye take the mate from a friend?"

"A gift for a gift," said Kamal straight; "a limb for the risk of a limb.

Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!"

With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest --

He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.

"Now here is thy master," Kamal said, "who leads a troop of the Guides,

And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.

Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,

Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.

So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,

And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,

And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power --

Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur."


They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,

They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:

They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,

On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.

The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,

And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.

And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear --

There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.

"Ha' done! ha' done!" said the Colonel's son.

  "Put up the steel at your sides!

Last night ye had struck at a Border thief --

  to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!"


    Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,

    Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;

    But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,

    When two strong men stand face to face,

      tho' they come from the ends of the earth!

Poem 240: The Ballad of Minepit Shaw


About the time that taverns shut

 And men can buy no beer,

Two lads went up to the keepers' hut

 To steal Lord Pelham's deer.


Night and the liquor was in their heads--

 They laughed and talked no bounds,

Till they waked the keepers on their beds

 And the keepers loosed the hounds.


They had killed a hart, they had killed a hind,

 Ready to carry away,

When they heard a whimper down the wind

 And they heard a bloodhound bay.


They took and ran across the fern,

 Their crossbows in their hand,

Till they met a man with a green lantern

 That called and bade 'em stand.


"What are ye doing, O Flesh and Blood,

 And what's your foolish will,

That you must break into Minepit Wood

 And wake the Folk of the Hill?"


"Oh, we've broke into Lord Pelham's park,

 And killed Lord Pelham's deer,

And if ever you heard a little dog bark

 You'll know why we come here.


"We ask you let us go our way,

 As fast as we can flee,

For if ever you heard a bloodhound bay

 You'll know how pressed we be."


"Oh, lay your crossbows on the bank

 And drop the knives from your hand,

And though the hounds be at your flank

 I'll save you where you stand!"


They laid their crossbows on the bank,

 They threw their knives in the wood,

And the ground before them opened and sank

 And saved 'em where they stood.


"Oh, what's the roaring in our ears

  That strikes us well-nigh dumb?"

"Oh, that is just how things appears

  According as they come."


"What are the stars before our eyes

  That strike us well-nigh blind?"

"Oh, that is just how things arise

  According as you find."


"And why's our bed so hard to the bones

  Excepting where it's cold?"

"Oh, that's because it is precious stones

  Excepting where 'tis gold.


"Think it over as you stand,

  For I tell you without fail,

If you haven't got into Fairyland

  You're not in Lewes Gaol."


All night long they thought of it,

 And, come the dawn, they saw

They'd tumbled into a great old pit,

 At the bottom of Minepit Shaw.


And the keeper's hound had followed 'em close,

 And broke her neck in the fall;

So they picked up their knives and their crossbows

 And buried the dog. That's all.


But whether the man was a poacher too

 Or a Pharisee' so bold--

I reckon there's more things told than are true.

 And more things true than are told!

Poem 241: The Ballad of the Cars


"Now this is the price of a stirrup-cup,"

 The kneeling doctor said.

And syne he bade them take him up,

 For he saw that the man was dead.


They took him up, and they laid him down

  ( And, oh, he did not stir ),

And they had him into the nearest town

 To wait the Coroner.


They drew the dead-cloth over the face,

 They closed the doors upon,

And the cars that were parked in the market-place

 Made talk of it anon.


Then up and spake a Daimler wide,

 That carries the slatted tank: --

"'Tis we must purge the country-side

 And no man will us thank.


"For while they pray at Holy Kirk

The souls should turn from sin,

We cock our bonnets to the work,

And gather the drunken in. --


"And if we spare them for the nonce, --

 Or their comrades jack them free, --

They learn more under our dumb-irons

 Than they learned at time mother's knee."


Then up and spake an Armstrong bold,

 And Siddeley, was his name: --

"I saw a man lie stark and cold

 By Grantham as I came.


"There was a blind turn by a brook,

  A guard-rail and a fail:

But the drunken loon that overtook

  He got no hurt at all!


"I ha' trodden the wet road and the dry --

  But and the shady lane;                '

And  why the  guiltless  soul  should die,

  Good reason find I nane."


Then up and spake the Babe Austin --

  Had barely room for two --

"'Tis time and place that make the sin,

  And not the deed they do.


"For when a man drives with his dear,

 I ha' seen it come to pass

That an arm too close or a lip too near

  Has killed  both  lad  and  lass.


"There was a car at eventide

 And a sidelings kiss to steal --

The God knows how the couple died,

 But I mind the inquest weel.


"I have trodden the black tar and the heath --

 But and the cobble-stone;

And why the young go to their death,

 Good reason find I none."


Then spake a Morris from Oxenford,

 ('Was keen to a Cowley Friar ): --

"How shall we judge the ways of the Lord

That are but steel and fire?



"Between the oil-pits under earth

 And the levin-spark from the skies,

We but adventure and go forth

 As our man shall devise:


"And if he have drunken a hoop too deep,

 No kinship can us move

To draw him home in his market-sleep

 Or spare his waiting love.


"There is never a lane in all England

 Where a mellow man can go,

But he must look on either hand

 And back and front also.


"But he must busk him every tide,

 At prick of horn, to leap  

Either to hide in ditch beside

 Or in the bankes steep.


"And whether he walk in drink or muse,

 Or for his love be bound,

We have no wit to mark and chuse,

 But needs must slay or wound."



They drew the dead-cloth from its face.

 The Crowner looked thereon;

And the cars that were parked in the market-place

 Went all their ways anon.

Poem 242: The Ballad of the Clampherdown


It was our war-ship Clampherdown

Would sweep the Channel clean,

Wherefore she kept her hatches close

When the merry Channel chops arose,

To save the bleached marine.


She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton

And a great stern-gun beside.

They dipped their noses deep in the sea,

They racked their stays and stanchions free

In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.


It was our war-ship Clampherdown,

Fell in with a cruiser light

That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun

And a pair of heels wherewith to run

From the grip of a close-fought fight.


She opened fire at seven miles --

As ye shoot at a bobbing cork --

And once she fired and twice she fired,

Till the bow-gun dropped like a lily tired

That lolls upon the stalk.


"Captain, the bow-gun melts apace,

The deck-beams break below,

'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain,

And botch the shattered plates again."

And he answered, "Make it so."


She opened fire within the mile --

As ye shoot at the flying duck --

And the great stern-gun shot fair and true,

With the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue,

And the great stern-turret stuck.


"Captain, the turret fills with steam,

The feed-pipes burst below --

You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,

You can hear the twisted runners jam."

And he answered, "Turn and go!"


It was our war-ship Clampherdown,

And grimly did she roll;

Swung round to take the cruiser's fire

As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire

When they war by the frozen Pole.


"Captain, the shells are falling fast,

And faster still fall we;

And it is not meet for English stock

To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock

The death they cannot see."


"Lie down, lie down, my bold A.B.,

We drift upon her beam;

We dare not ram, for she can run;

And dare ye fire another gun,

And die in the peeling steam?"


It was our war-ship Clampherdown

That carried an armour-belt;

But fifty feet at stern and bow

Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,

To the hail of the Nordenfeldt.


"Captain, they hack us through and through;

The chilled steel bolts are swift!

We have emptied our bunkers in open sea,

Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be."

And he answered, "Let her drift."


It was our war-ship Clampherdown,

Swung round upon the tide,

Her two dumb guns glared south and north,

And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth,

And she ground the cruiser's side.


"Captain, they cry, the fight is done,

They bid you send your sword."

And he answered, "Grapple her stern and bow.

They have asked for the steel.  They shall have it now;

Out cutlasses and board!"


It was our war-ship Clampherdown

Spewed up four hundred men;

And the scalded stokers yelped delight,

As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight,

Stamp o'er their steel-walled pen.


They cleared the cruiser end to end,

From conning-tower to hold.

They fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;

They were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,

As it was in the days of old.


It was the sinking Clampherdown

Heaved up her battered side --

And carried a million pounds in steel,

To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,

And the scour of the Channel tide.


It was the crew of the Clampherdown

Stood out to sweep the sea,

On a cruiser won from an ancient foe,

As it was in the days of long ago,

And as it still shall be!

Poem 243: The Ballad Of The King's Jest


When spring-time flushes the desert grass,

Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass.

Lean are the camels but fat the frails,

Light are the purses but heavy the bales,

As the snowbound trade of the North comes down

To the market-square of Peshawur town.


In a turquoise twilight, crisp and chill,

A kafila camped at the foot of the hill.

Then blue smoke-haze of the cooking rose,

And tent-peg answered to  hammer-nose;

And the picketed ponies, shag and wild,

Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled;

And the bubbling camels beside the load

Sprawled for a furlong adown the road;

And the Persian pussy-cats, brought for sale,

Spat at the dogs from the camel-bale;

And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food;

And the camp-fires twinkled by Fort Jumrood;

And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk

A savour of camels and carpets and musk,

A murmur of voices, a reek of smoke,

To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke.


The lid of the flesh-pot chattered high,

The knives were whetted and -- then came I

To Mahbub Ali the muleteer,

Patching his bridles and counting his gear,

Crammed with the gossip of half a year.

But Mahbub Ali the kindly said,

"Better is speech when the belly is fed."

So we plunged the hand to the mid-wrist deep

In a cinnamon stew of the fat-tailed sheep,

And he who never hath tasted the food,

By Allah! he knoweth not bad from good.


We cleansed our beards of the mutton-grease,

We lay on the mats and were filled with peace,

And the talk slid north, and the talk slid south,

With the sliding puffs from the hookah-mouth.

Four things greater than all things are, --

Women and Horses and Power and War.

We spake of them all, but the last the most,

For I sought a word of a Russian post,

Of a shifty promise, an unsheathed sword

And a gray-coat guard on the Helmund ford.

Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes

In the fashion of one who is weaving lies.

Quoth he:  "Of the Russians who can say?

When the night is gathering all is gray.

But we look that the gloom of the night shall die

In the morning flush of a blood-red sky.

Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise

To warn a King of his enemies?

We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,

But no man knoweth the mind of the King.

That unsought counsel is cursed of God

Attesteth the story of Wali Dad.


"His sire was leaky of tongue and pen,

His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen;

And the colt bred close to the vice of each,

For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech.

Therewith madness -- so that he sought

The favour of kings at the Kabul court;

And travelled, in hope of honour, far

To the line where the gray-coat squadrons are.

There have I journeyed too -- but I

Saw naught, said naught, and -- did not die!

He harked to rumour, and snatched at a breath

Of `this one knoweth' and `that one saith', --

Legends that ran from mouth to mouth

Of a gray-coat coming, and sack of the South.

These have I also heard -- they pass

With each new spring and the winter grass.


"Hot-foot southward, forgotten of God,

Back to the city ran Wali Dad,

Even to Kabul -- in full durbar

The King held talk with his Chief in War.

Into the press of the crowd he broke,

And what he had heard of the coming spoke.


"Then Gholam Hyder, the Red Chief, smiled,

As a mother might on a babbling child;

But those who would laugh restrained their breath,

When the face of the King showed dark as death.

Evil it is in full durbar

To cry to a ruler of gathering war!

Slowly he led to a peach-tree small,

That grew by a cleft of the city wall.

And he said to the boy:  `They shall praise thy zeal

So long as the red spurt follows the steel.

And the Russ is upon us even now?

Great is thy prudence -- await them, thou.

Watch from the tree.  Thou art young and strong,

Surely thy vigil is not for long.

The Russ is upon us, thy clamour ran?

Surely an hour shall bring their van.

Wait and watch.  When the host is near,

Shout aloud that my men may hear.'


"Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise

To warn a King of his enemies?

A guard was set that he might not flee --

A score of bayonets ringed the tree.

The peach-bloom fell in showers of snow,

When he shook at his death as he looked below.

By the power of God, who alone is great,

Till the seventh day he fought with his fate.

Then madness took him, and men declare

He mowed in the branches as ape and bear,

And last as a sloth, ere his body failed,

And he hung as a bat in the forks, and wailed,

And sleep the cord of his hands untied,

And he fell, and was caught on the points and died.


"Heart of my heart, is it meet or wise

To warn a King of his enemies?

We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,

But no man knoweth the mind of the King.

Of the gray-coat coming who can say?

When the night is gathering all is gray.

Two things greater than all things are,

The first is Love, and the second War.

And since we know not how War may prove,

Heart of my heart, let us talk of Love!"

Poem 244: The Ballad Of The King's Mercy


Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, of him is the story told.

          His mercy fills the Khyber hills -- his grace is manifold;

          He has taken toll of the North and the South --

            his glory reacheth far,

          And they tell the tale of his charity from Balkh to Kandahar.


Before the old Peshawur Gate, where Kurd and Kaffir meet,

The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street,

And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife,

Tho' he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life.


There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai,

Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die.

It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife;

The Kaffir grovelled under-hoof and clamoured for his life.


Then said the King:  "Have hope, O friend!  Yea, Death disgraced is hard;

Much honour shall be thine"; and called the Captain of the Guard,

Yar Khan, a bastard of the Blood, so city-babble saith,

And he was honoured of the King -- the which is salt to Death;

And he was son of Daoud Shah, the Reiver of the Plains,

And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins;

And 'twas to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind,

The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind.


"Strike!" said the King.  "King's blood art thou --

  his death shall be his pride!"

Then louder, that the crowd might catch:  "Fear not -- his arms are tied!"

Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife, and struck, and sheathed again.

"O man, thy will is done," quoth he; "a King this dog hath slain."


          Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, to the North and the South is sold.

          The North and the South shall open their mouth

            to a Ghilzai flag unrolled,

          When the big guns speak to the Khyber peak, and his dog-Heratis fly:

          Ye have heard the song -- How long?  How long?

            Wolves of the Abazai!


That night before the watch was set, when all the streets were clear,

The Governor of Kabul spoke:  "My King, hast thou no fear?

Thou knowest -- thou hast heard," -- his speech died at his master's face.

And grimly said the Afghan King:  "I rule the Afghan race.

My path is mine -- see thou to thine -- to-night upon thy bed

Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head."


That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne,

Within a little garden-house the King lay down alone.

Before the sinking of the moon, which is the Night of Night,

Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white.

The children of the town had mocked beneath his horse's hoofs,

The harlots of the town had hailed him "butcher!" from their roofs.

But as he groped against the wall, two hands upon him fell,

The King behind his shoulder spake:  "Dead man, thou dost not well!

'Tis ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night;

And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write.

But three days hence, if God be good, and if thy strength remain,

Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain.

For I am merciful to all, and most of all to thee.

My butcher of the shambles, rest -- no knife hast thou for me!"


          Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief,

            holds hard by the South and the North;

          But the Ghilzai knows, ere the melting snows,

            when the swollen banks break forth,

          When the red-coats crawl to the sungar wall,

            and his Usbeg lances fail:

          Ye have heard the song -- How long?  How long?

            Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl!


They stoned him in the rubbish-field when dawn was in the sky,

According to the written word, "See that he do not die."


They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain,

And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again.


One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing,

And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King.


It was upon the second night, the night of Ramazan,

The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan.

From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath,

"Creature of God, deliver me from agony of Death."


They sought the King among his girls, and risked their lives thereby:

"Protector of the Pitiful, give orders that he die!"


"Bid him endure until the day," a lagging answer came;

"The night is short, and he can pray and learn to bless my name."


Before the dawn three times he spoke, and on the day once more:

"Creature of God, deliver me, and bless the King therefor!"


They shot him at the morning prayer, to ease him of his pain,

And when he heard the matchlocks clink, he blessed the King again.


Which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing,

So that the Outer Seas may know the mercy of the King.


          Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, of him is the story told,

          He has opened his mouth to the North and the South,

            they have stuffed his mouth with gold.

          Ye know the truth of his tender ruth -- and sweet his favours are:

          Ye have heard the song -- How long?  How long?

            from Balkh to Kandahar.

Poem 245: The Ballad of the Red Earl


It is not for them to criticize too minutely the methods the Irish followed, though they might deplore some of their results. During the past few years Ireland had been going through what was tantamount to a revolution. -- EARL SPENCER



Red Earl, and will ye take for guide

 The silly camel-birds,

That ye bury your head in an Irish thorn,

 On a desert of drifting words?


Ye have followed a man for a God, Red Earl,

 As the Lord o' Wrong and Right;

But the day is done with the setting sun

 Will ye follow into the night?


He gave you your own old words, Red Earl,

 For food on the wastrel way;

Will ye rise and eat in the night, Red Earl,

 That fed so full in the day?


Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far,

 And where did the wandering lead?

From the day that ye praised the spoken word

 To the day ye must gloss the deed.


And as ye have given your hand for gain,

 So must ye give in loss;

And as ye ha' come to the brink of the pit,

 So must ye loup across.


For some be rogues in grain, Red Earl,

 And some be rogues in fact,

And rogues direct and rogues elect;

 But all be rogues in pact.


Ye have cast your lot with these, Red Earl;

 Take heed to where ye stand.

Ye have tied a knot with your tongue, Red Earl,

 That ye cannot loose with your hand.


Ye have travelled fast, ye have travelled far,

 In the grip of a tightening tether,

Till ye find at the end ye must take for friend

 The quick and their dead together.


Ye have played with the Law between your lips,

 And mouthed it daintilee;

But the gist o' the speech is ill to teach,

 For ye say: "Let wrong go free."


Red Earl, ye wear the Garter fair,

 And gat your place from a King:

Do ye make Rebellion of no account,

 And Treason a little thing?


And have ye weighed your words, Red Earl,

 That stand and speak so high?

And is it good that the guilt o' blood,

 Be cleared at the cost of a sigh?


And is it well for the sake of peace,

 Our tattered Honour to sell,

And higgle anew with a tainted crew --

 Red Earl, and is it well?


Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far,

 On a dark and doubtful way,

 And the road is hard, is hard, Red Earl,

   And the price is yet to pay.


Ye shall pay that price as ye reap reward

 For the toil of your tongue and pen --

In the praise of the blamed and the thanks of the shamed,

 And the honour o' knavish men.


They scarce shall veil their scorn, Red Earl,

 And the worst at the last shall be,

When you tell your heart that it does not know

 And your eye that it does not see.

"Hide from your neighbours as much as you please,

                               As curious as a man!


            Don't you wait where the trees are,

           Nor don't you hate where Bees are,

Poem 247: The Bees and Flies


A Farmer of the Augustan Age

Perused in Virgil's golden page

The story of the secret won

From Proteus by Cyrene's son--

How the dank sea-god showed the swain

Means to restore his hives again.

More briefly, how a slaughtered bull

Breeds honey by the bellyful.


The egregious rustic put to death

A bull by stopping of its breath,

Disposed the carcass in a shed

With fragrant herbs and branches spread,

And, having well performed the charm,

Sat down to wait the promised swarm.


Nor waited long. The God of Day

Impartial, quickening with his ray

Evil and good alike, beheld

The carcass--and the carcass swelled.

Big with new birth the belly heaves

Beneath its screen of scented leaves.

Past any doubt, the bull conceives!


The farmer bids men bring more hives

To house the profit that arrives;

Prepares on pan and key and kettle,

Sweet music that shall make 'em settle;

But when to crown the work he goes,

Gods! What a stink salutes his nose!


Where are the honest toilers? Where

The gravid mistress of their care?

A busy scene, indeed, he sees,

But not a sign or sound of bees.

Worms of the riper grave unhid

By any kindly coffin-lid,

Obscene and shameless to the light,

Seethe in insatiate appetite,

Through putrid offal, while above

The hissing blow-fly seeks his love,

Whose offspring, supping where they supt,

Consume corruption twice corrupt.

After He Has Been Extemporising On an Instrument Not Of His Own Invention -- Browning



Lo! What is this that I make -- sudden, supreme, unrehearsed --

This that my clutch in the crowd pressed at a venture has raised?

Forward and onward I sprang when I thought (as I ought) I reversed,

And a cab like martagon opes and I sit in the wreckage dazed.


And someone is taking my name, and the driver is rending the air

With cries for my blood and my gold, and a snickering news-boy brings

My cap, wheel-pashed from the kerb. I must run her home for repair,

Where she leers with her bonnet awry--flat on the nether springs!

Poem 250: The Beginnings


It was not part of their blood,

    It came to them very late

  With long arrears to make good,

    When the English began to hate.


  They were not easily moved,

     They were icy-willing to wait

  Till every count should be proved,

    Ere the English began to hate.


  Their voices were even and low,

    Their eyes were level and straight.

  There was neither sign nor show,

    When the English began to hate.


  It was not preached to the crowd,

    It was not taught by the State.

  No man spoke it aloud,  

    When the English began to hate.


  It  was not suddenly bred,

    It  will not swiftly abate,

  Through the chill years ahead,

    When Time shall count from the date

    That the English began to hate.

Poem 251: The Bell Buoy


They christened my brother of old--

    And a saintly name he bears--

They gave him his place to hold

 At the head of the belfry-stairs,

 Where the minister-towers stand

And the breeding kestrels cry.

 Would I change with my brother a league inland?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


In the flush of the hot June prime,

 O'er sleek flood-tides afire,

I hear him hurry the chime

 To the bidding of checked Desire;

 Till the sweated ringers tire

And the wild bob-majors die.

 Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


When the smoking scud is blown--

 When the greasy wind-rack lowers--

Apart and at peace and alone,

 He counts the changeless hours.

 He wars with darkling Powers

(I war with a darkling sea);

 Would he stoop to my work in the gusty mirk?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not he!


There was never a priest to pray

 There was never a hand to toll,

When they made me guard of the bay,

 And moored me over the shoal.

I rock, I reel, and I roll--

My four great hammers ply--

Could I speak or be still at the Church's will?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


The landward marks have failed,

 The fog-bank glides unguessed,

The seaward lights are veiled,

 The spent deep feigns her rest:

 But my ear is laid to her breast,

I lift to the swell--I cry!

 Could I wait in sloth on the Church's oath?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


At the careless end of night

 I thrill to the nearing screw;

I turn in the clearing light

 And I call to the drowsy crew;

 And the mud boils foul and blue

As the blind bow backs away.

 Will they give me their thanks if they clear the banks?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not they!


The beach-pools cake and skim,

 The bursting spray-heads freeze,

I gather on crown and rim

 The grey, grained ice of the seas,

 Where, sheathed from bitt to trees,

The plunging colliers lie.

 Would I barter my place for the Church's grace?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


Through the blur of the whirling snow,

 Or the black of the inky sleet,  

The lanterns gather and grow,

 And I look for the homeward fleet.

 Rattle of block and sheet--

"Ready about-stand by!"

 Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!


I dip and I surge and I swing

 In the rip of the racing tide,

By the gates of doom I sing,

 On the horns of death I ride.

 A ship-length overside,

Between the course and the sand,

 Fretted and bound I bide

       Peril whereof I cry.

Would I change with my brother a league inland?

(Shoal! 'Ware shoal!) Not I!

Poem 253: The Benefactors


Ah! What avails the classic bent

And what the cultured word,

Against the undoctored incident

That actually occurred?


And what is Art whereto we press

Through paint and prose and rhyme--

When Nature in her nakedness

Defeats us every time?


It is not learning, grace nor gear,

 Nor easy meat and drink,

But bitter pinch of pain and fear

 That makes creation think.



When in this world's unpleasing youth

 Our godlike race began,

The longest arm, the sharpest tooth,

 Gave man control of man;



Till, bruised and bitten to the bone

 And taught by pain and fear,

He learned to deal the far-off stone,

 And poke the long, safe spear.


So tooth and nail were obsolete

 As means against a foe,

Till, bored by uniform defeat,

 Some genius built the bow.


Then stone and javelin proved as vain

 As old-time tooth and nail;

Till, spurred anew by fear and pain,

 Man fashioned coats of mail.


Then was there safety for the rich

 And danger for the poor,

Till someone mixed a powder which

 Redressed the scale once more.


Helmet and armour disappeared

 With sword and bow and pike,

And, when the smoke of battle cleared,

 All men were armed alike.   .   .   .


And when ten million such were slain

 To please one crazy king,

Man, schooled in bulk by fear and pain,

 Grew weary of the thing;


And, at the very hour designed,

 To enslave him past recall,

His tooth-stone-arrow-gun-shy mind

 Turned and abolished all.


All Power, each Tyrant, every Mob

Whose head has grown too large,

Ends by destroying its own job

And works its own discharge;


And Man, whose mere necessities

Move all things from his path,

Trembles meanwhile at their decrees,

And deprecates their wrath!

Poem 254: The Betrothed


Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,

For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.


We quarrelled about Havanas -- we fought o'er a good cheroot,

And I knew she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.


Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider a space;

In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.


Maggie is pretty to look at -- Maggie's a loving lass,

But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.


There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;

But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away --


Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown --

But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!


Maggie, my wife at fifty -- grey and dour and old --

With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!


And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,

And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar --


The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket --

With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!


Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider a while.

Here is a mild Manila -- there is a wifely smile.


Which is the better portion -- bondage bought with a ring,

Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied in a string?


Counsellors cunning and silent -- comforters true and tried,

And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?


Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,

Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,


This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,

With only a Suttee's passion -- to do their duty and burn.


This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,

Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.


The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,

When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.


I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,

So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.


I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,

And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.


For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between

The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o' Teen.


And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,

But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;


And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light

Of stums that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.


And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,

But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.


Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?

Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?


Open the old cigar-box -- let me consider anew --

Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon you?


A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;

And a woman is only a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.


Light me another Cuba -- I hold to my first-sworn vows.

If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

To find and t'other half to bring to blaze:

Rubies of every heat, wherethrough we scan

The fiercer and more fiery heart of man:

Emerald that with the uplifted billow vies,

And Sapphires evening remembered skies:

Pearl perfect, as immortal tears must show,

Bred, in deep waters, of a piercing woe;

And tender Turkis, so with charms y-writ,

Of woven gold, Time dares not bite on it.

Thereafter, in all manners worked and set,

Jade, coral, amber, crystal ivories, jet,--

Showing no more than various fancies, yet

Each a Life's token or Love's amulet

Which things, through timeless arrogance of use,

We neither guard nor garner, but abuse;

So that our scholars--nay, our children-fling

In sport or jest treasure to arm a King;

And the gross crowd, at feast or market, hold

Traffic perforce with dust of gems and gold!

Poem 256: The Bother


Clough



Hastily Adam our driver swallowed a curse in the darkness--

Petrol nigh at end and something wrong with a sprocket

Made him speer for the nearest town, when lo!  at the crossways

Four blank letterless arms the virginal signpost extended.

"Look!" thundered Hugh the Radical. "This is the England we

     boast of--

Bland, white-bellied, obese, but utterly useless  for business.

They are repainting the signs and have left the job in the middle.

They are repainting  the  signs and traffic may stop till they've

     done it,

Which is to say: till the son-of-a-gun of a local contractor,

Having laboriously wiped out every name for

Probably thirty miles round, be minded to finish his labour!

Had not the fool the sense to paint out and paint in together?"


Thus, not seeing his speech belied his Radical Gospel

(Which is to paint out the earth and then write "Damn" on the

         shutter),

Hugh embroidered the theme imperially and stretched it

From some borough in Wales through our Australian possessions,

Poem 258: The Broken Men


For things we never mention,

 For Art misunderstood --

For excellent intention

 That did not turn to good;

From ancient tales' renewing,

 From clouds we would not clear --

Beyond the Law's pursuing

 We fled, and settled here.


We took no tearful leaving,

 We bade no long good-byes.

Men talked of crime and thieving,

 Men wrote of fraud and lies.

To save our injured feelings

 'Twas time and time to go --

Behind was dock and Dartmoor,

 Ahead lay Callao!


The widow and the orphan

 That pray for ten per cent,

They clapped their trailers on us

 To spy the road we went.

They watched the foreign sailings

 (They scan the shipping still),

And that's your Christian people

 Returning good for ill!


God bless the thoughtful islands

 Where never warrants come;

God bless the just Republics

 That give a man a home,

That ask no foolish questions,

 But set him on his feet;

And save his wife and daughters

 From the workhouse and the street!


On church and square and market

 The noonday silence falls;

You'll hear the drowsy mutter

 Of the fountain in our halls.

Asleep amid the yuccas

 The city takes her ease --

Till twilight brings the land-wind

 To the clicking jalousies.


Day long the diamond weather,

 The high, unaltered blue --

The smell of goats and incense

 And the mule-bells tinkling through.

Day long the warder ocean

 That keeps us from our kin,

And once a month our levee

 When the English mail comes in.


You'll find us up and waiting

 To treat you at the bar;

You'll find us less exclusive

 Than the average English are.

We'll meet you with a carriage,

 Too glad to show you round,

But -- we do not lunch on steamers,

 For they are English ground.


We sail o' nights to England

 And join our smiling Boards --

Our wives go in with Viscounts

 And our daughters dance with Lords,

But behind our princely doings,

 And behind each coup we make,

We feel there's Something Waiting,

 And -- we meet It when we wake.


Ah, God! One sniff of England --

 To greet our flesh and blood --

To hear the traffic slurring

 Once more through London mud!

Our towns of wasted honour --

 Our streets of lost delight!

How stands the old Lord Warden?

 Are Dover's cliffs still white?

Poem 260: The Burden


One grief on me is laid

  Each day of every year,

Wherein no soul can aid,

  Whereof no soul can hear:

Whereto no end is seen

  Except to grieve again--

Ah, Mary Magdalene,

  Where is there greater pain?


To dream on dear disgrace

  Each hour of every day--

To bring no honest face

  To aught I do or say:

To lie from morn till e'en--

  To know my lies are vain--

Ah, Mary Magdalene,

  Where can be greater pain?


To watch my steadfast fear

  Attend mine every way

Each day of every year--

  Each hour of every day:

To burn, and chill between--

  To quake and rage again--

Ah, Mary Magdalene,

  Where shall be greater pain:


One grave to me was given--

To guard till Judgment Day--

But God looked down from Heaven

And rolled the Stone away!

One day of all my years--

One hour of that one day--

His Angel saw my tears

And rolled the Stone away!

Dreamer devout, by vision led

 Beyond our guess or reach,

The travail of his spirit bred

 Cities in place of speech.

So huge the all-mastering thought that drove --

 So brief the term allowed --

Nations, not words, he linked to prove

 His faith before the crowd.


It is his will that he look forth

 Across the world he won --

The granite of the ancient North --

 Great spaces washed with sun.


There shall he patient take his seat

 (As when the Death he dared),

And there await a people's feet

 In the paths that he prepared.


There, till the vision he foresaw

 Splendid and whole arise,

And unimagined Empires draw

 To council 'neath his skies,

The immense and brooding Spirit still

 Shall quicken and control.

Living he was the land, and dead,

 His soul shall be her soul!

Poem 263: The Camels Hump


The Camel's hump is an ugly lump

Which well you may see at the Zoo;

But uglier yet is the hump we get

From having too little to do.


Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,

If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,

We get the hump-

Cameelious hump-

The hump that is black and blue!


We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,

And a snarly-yarly voice.

We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl

At our bath and our boots and our toys;


And there ought to be a corner for me

(And I know' there is one for you)

When we get the hump-

Cameelious hump-

The hump that is black and blue!


The cure for this ill is not to sit still,

Or frowst with a book by the fire;

But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,

And dig till you gently perspire;


And then you will find that the sun and the wind,

And the Djinn of the Garden too,

Have lifted the hump-

The horrible hump-

The hum that is black and blue!


I get it as well as you-oo-oo-

If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo!

We all get hump-

Cameelious hump-

Kiddies and grown-ups too!

Poem 264: The Captive


Not with an outcry to Allah nor any complaining

He answered his name at the muster and stood to the chaining.

When  the twin  anklets were nipped  on the leg-bars  that held them,

He brotherly greeted the armourers stooping to weld them.

Ere the sad dust of the marshalled feet of the chain-gang swallowed him,

Observing him nobly at ease, I alighted and followed him,

Thus we had speech by the way, but not touching his sorrow--

Rather his red Yesterday and his regal To-morrow,

Wherein he statelily moved to the clink of his chains unregarded,

Nowise abashed but contented to drink of the potion awarded

Saluting aloofly his Fate, he made haste with his story,

And the words of his mouth were as slaves spreading carpets of glory

Embroidered with names of the Djinns--a miraculous weaving--

But the cool and perspicuous eye overbore unbelieving.

So I submitted myself to the limits of rapture--

Bound by this man we had bound, amid captives his capture--

Till he returned me to earth and the visions departed.

But on him be the Peace and the Blessing; for he was greathearted!

Poem 266: The Centaurs


Up came the young Centaur-colts from the plains they were

      fathered in--

  Curious, awkward, afraid.

Burrs on their hocks and their tails, they were branded and gathered in

 Mobs and run up to the yard to be made.


Starting and shying at straws, with sidlings and plungings,

 Buckings and whirlings and bolts;

Greener than grass, but full-ripe for their bridling and lungings,

 Up to the yards and to Chiron they bustled the colts...


First the light web and the cavesson; then the linked keys

 To jingle and turn on the tongue. Then, with cocked ears,

The hours of watching and envy, while comrades at ease

 Passaged and backed, making naught of these terrible gears.


Next, over-pride and its price at the low-seeming fence

 Too oft and too easily taken -- the world-beheld fall!

And none in the yard except Chiron to doubt the immense,

 Irretrievable shame of it all!...


Last, the trained squadron, full-charge -- the sound of a going

 Through dust and spun clods, and strong kicks, pelted in as

      they went,

And repaid at top-speed; till the order to halt without slowing

 Showed every colt on his haunches--and Chiron content!

And we both abandoned our own affairs

 And took to the dreadful seas.


Wet and worry about our ways--

 Panic, onset and flight--

Had us in charge for a thousand days

 And thousand-year-long night.


We saw more than the nights could hide--

 More than the waves could keep--

And--certain faces over the side

 Which do not go from our sleep.


We were more tired than words can tell

 While the pied craft fled by,

And the swinging mounds of the Western swell

 Hoisted us Heavens-high...


Now there is nothing -- not even our rank--

 To witness what we have been;

And I am returned to my Walworth Bank

 And you to your margarine!

Poem 268: The Children


These were our children who died for our lands: they were dear in our sight.

We have only the memory left of their hometreasured sayings and laughter.

The price of our loss shall be paid to our hands, not another's hereafter.

Neither the Alien nor Priest shall decide on it. That is our right.

But who shall return us the children ?

At the hour the Barbarian chose to disclose his pretences,

And raged against Man, they engaged, on the breasts that they bared for us,

The first felon-stroke of the sword he had longtime prepared for us -

Their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences.


They bought us anew with their blood, forbearing to blame us,

Those hours which we had not made good when the Judgment o'ercame us.

They believed us and perished for it. Our statecraft, our learning

Delivered them bound to the Pit and alive to the burning

Whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour.

Not since her birth has our Earth seen such worth loosed upon her!


Nor was their agony brief, or once only imposed on them.

The wounded, the war-spent, the sick received no exemption:

Being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption,

Hopeless themselves of relief, till Death, marvelling, closed on them.


That flesh we had nursed from the first in all cleanness was given

To corruption unveiled and assailed by the malice of Heaven -

By the heart-shaking jests of Decay where it lolled on the wires

To be blanched or gay-painted by fumes - to be cindered by fires -

To be senselessly tossed and retossed in stale mutilation

From crater to crater. For this we shall take expiation.

But who shall return us our children?

And Love to all men 'neath the sun!

Once more to us the eternal choice

 Of good or ill is given.

But after the fires and the wrath,

 But after searching and pain,

His Mercy opens us a path

 To live with ourselves again.


In the Gates of Death rejoice!

Bear witness, Earth, we have made our choice

 For Freedom's brotherhood.

 Whose Strength hath saved us whole,

Who bade us choose that the Flesh should die

 And not the living Soul!

Our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees;

Our loins are battered 'neath us by the swinging, smoking seas.

From reef and rock and skerry -- over headland, ness, and voe --

The Coastwise Lights of England watch the ships of England go!


Through the endless summer evenings, on the lineless, level floors;

Through the yelling Channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars --

By day the dipping house-flag and by night the rocket's trail --

As the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail.


We bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care,

The flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer;

From our vexed eyries, head to gale, we bind in burning chains

The lover from the sea-rim drawn -- his love in English lanes.


We greet the clippers wing-and-wing that race the Southern wool;

We warn the crawling cargo-tanks of Bremen, Leith, and Hull;

To each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea --

The white wall-sided war-ships or the whalers of Dundee!


Come up, come in from Eastward, from the guardports of the Morn!

Beat up, beat in from Southerly, O gipsies of the Horn!

Swift shuttles of an Empire's loom that weave us, main to main,

The Coastwise Lights of England give you welcome back again!


Go, get you gone up-Channel with the sea-crust on your plates;

Go, get you into London with the burden of your freights!

Haste, for they talk of Empire there, and say, if any seek,

The Lights of England sent you and by silence shall ye speak!

For a bite and a sup, and a bed of clean straw,

We'll tell you such marvels as man never saw,

On a Magical Island which no one did spy

Save this Master, that Swabber, yon Bo'sun, and I.


Seven months among Mermaids and Devils and Sprites,

And Voices that howl in the cedars o'nights,

With further enchantments we underwent there.

Good Sirs, 'tis a tale to draw guts from a bear!


'Twixt Dover and Southwark it paid us our way,

Where we found some poor players were labouring a play;

And, willing to search what such business might be,

We entered the yard, both to hear and to see.


One hailed us for seamen and courteous-ly

Did guide us apart to a tavern near by

Where we told him our tale (as to many of late),

And he gave us good cheer, so we gave him good weight.


Mulled sack and strong waters on bellies well lined

With beef and black pudding do strengthen the mind;

And seeing him greedy for marvels, at last

From plain salted truth to flat leasing we passed.


But he, when on midnight our reckoning he paid,

Says, "Never match coins with a Coiner by trade,

Or he'll turn your lead pieces to metal as rare

As shall fill him this globe, and leave something  to spare...."


We slept where they laid us, and when we awoke

Was a crown or five shillings in every man's poke.

We bit them and rang them, and, finding them good,

We drank to that Coiner as honest men should!

Poem 275: The Conundrum Of The Workshops


When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden's green and gold,

Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould;

And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart,

Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, "It's pretty, but is it Art?"


Wherefore he called to his wife, and fled to fashion his work anew --

The first of his race who cared a fig for the first, most dread review;

And he left his lore to the use of his sons -- and that was a glorious gain

When the Devil chuckled "Is it Art?" in the ear of the branded Cain.


They fought and they talked in the North and the South,

  they talked and they fought in the West,

Till the waters rose on the pitiful land, and the poor Red Clay had rest --

Had rest till that dank blank-canvas dawn when the dove was preened to start,

And the Devil bubbled below the keel:  "It's human, but is it Art?"


They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart,

Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks:  "It's striking, but is it Art?"

The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung,

While each man talked of the aims of Art, and each in an alien tongue.


The tale is as old as the Eden Tree -- and new as the new-cut tooth --

For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth;

And each man hears as the twilight nears, to the beat of his dying heart,

The Devil drum on the darkened pane:  "You did it, but was it Art?"


We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplice-peg,

We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg,

We know that the tail must wag the dog, for the horse is drawn by the cart;

But the Devil whoops, as he whooped of old:  "It's clever, but is it Art?"


When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room's green and gold,

The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould --

They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves,

  and the ink and the anguish start,

For the Devil mutters behind the leaves:  "It's pretty, but is it Art?"


Now, if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow,

And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago,

And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through,

By the favour of God we might know as much -- as our father Adam knew!

Dews, he had listened to gipsy Juliet

How at Bankside, a boy drowning kittens

Winced at the business; whereupon his sister--

Lady Macbeth aged seven--thrust 'em under,

 Trebled the mileage man could cover;

When Sh--nks's Mare was H--bs--n's Choice,

 And Bl--r--ot had not flown to Dover:

When good hoteliers looked askance

 If any power save horse-flesh drew vans--

'Time was in easy, hand-made France,

 I met the Cure of Saint Juvans.


He was no babbler, but, at last,

 One learned from things he left unspoken

How in some fiery, far-off past,

 His, and a woman's, heart were broken.

He sought for death, but found it not,

 Yet, seeking, found his true vocation,

And fifty years, by all forgot,

 Toiled at a simple folk's salvation.


His pay was lower than our Dole;

 The piteous little church he tended

Had neither roof nor vestments whole

 Save what his own hard fingers mended:

While, any hour, at every need

 (As Conscience or La Grippe assailed 'em),

His parish bade him come with speed,

 And, foot or cart, he never failed 'em,


His speech--to suit his hearers--ran

 From pure Parisian to gross peasant,

With interludes North African

 If any Legionnaire were present:

And when some wine-ripe atheist mocked

 His office or the Faith he knelt in,

He left the sinner dumb and shocked

 By oaths his old Battalion dealt in.


And he was learned in Death and Life;

 And he was Logic's self (as France is).

He knew his flock-man, maid, and wife--

 Their forebears, failings, and finances.

Spite, Avarice, Devotion, Lies--

 Passion ablaze or sick Obsession--

He dealt with each physician-wise;

 Stern or most tender, at Confession...


To-day? God knows where he may lie--

 His Cross of weathered beads above him:

But one not worthy to untie

 His shoe-string, prays you read--and love him!

Poem 281: The Dawn Wind


At two o'clock in the morning, if you open your window and

   listen,

 You will hear the feet of the Wind that is going to call the sun.

And the trees in the shadow rustle, and the trees in the moonlight

   glisten,

 And though it is deep, dark night, you feel that the night is

   done.


So do the cows in the field. They graze for an hour and lie down,

 Dozing and chewing the cud; or a bird in the ivy wakes,

Chirrups one note and is still, and the restless Wind stares on,

 Fidgeting far down the road, till, softly, the darkness breaks.


Back comes the Wind full strength with a blow like an angel's

  wing,

Gentle but waking the world, as he shouts: "The Sun! The

     Sun!"

And the light floods over the fields and the birds begin to sing,

And the Wind dies down in the grass. It is day and his work

   is done.


So when the world is asleep, and there seems no hope of her

     waking

 Out of some long, bad dream that makes her mutter and moan,

Suddenly, all men arise to the noise of fetters breaking,

 And every one smiles at his neighbor and tells him his soul is

    his own!

Poem 282: The Dead King


Who in the Realm to-day lays down dear life for the sake of a land more dear?

And, unconcerned for his own estate, toils till the last grudged sands have run?

Let him approach. It is proven here

Our King asks nothing of any man more than Our King himself, has done.


For to him above all was Life good, above all he commanded

Her abundance full-handed.

The peculiar treasure of Kings was his for the taking:

All that men come to in dreams he inherited waking: --


His  marvel  of world-gathered armies -- one heart and all races;

His seas 'neath his keels when his war-castles foamed to their places;

The thundering foreshores that answered his heralded landing;

The huge lighted cities adoring, the assemblies upstanding;

The Councils of Kings called in haste to learn how he was minded --

The kingdoms, the Powers, and the Glories he dealt with unblinded.


To him came all captains of men, all achievers of glory

Hot from the press of their battles they told him their story.

They revealed him their lives in an hour and, saluting departed,

Joyful to labour afresh -- he had made them new-hearted.

And, since he weighed men from his youth, and no lie long deceived him,

He spoke and exacted the truth, and the basest believed him.


And God poured him an exquisite wine, that was daily renewed to him,

In the clear-welling love of his peoples that daily accrued to him.

Honour and service we gave him, rejoicingly fearless;

Faith absolute, trust beyond speech and a friendship as peerless.

And since he was Master and Servant in all that we asked him,

We leaned hard on his wisdom in all things, knowing not how we tasked him.

For on him each new day laid command, every tyrannous hour,

To confront, or confirm, or make smooth some dread issue of power;

To deliver true, judgment aright at the instant, unaided,

In the strict, level, ultimate phrase that allowed or dissuaded;

To foresee, to allay, to avert from us perils unnumbered,

To stand guard on our gates when he guessed that the watchmen had slumbered;

To win time, to turn hate, to woo folly to service and, mightily schooling

His strength to the use of his Nations, to rule as not ruling.


These were the works of our King; Earth's peace was the proof of them.

God gave him great works to fulfil, and to us the behoof of them.

We accepted his toil as our right -- none spared, none excused him.

When he was bowed by his burden his rest was refused him.

We troubled his age with our weakness -- the blacker our shame to us!

Hearing his People had need of him, straightway he came to us.


As he received so he gave -- nothing grudged, naught denying,

Not even the last gasp of his breath when he strove for us, dying.

For our sakes, without question, he put from him all that he cherished.

Simply as any that serve him he served and he perished.

All that Kings covet was his, and he flung it aside for us.

Simply as any that die in his service he died for us!


Who in the Realm to-day has choice of the easy road or the hard to tread?

And, much concerned for his own estate, would sell his soul to remain in the sun?

Let him depart nor look on Our dead.

Our King asks nothing of any man more than Our King himself has done.

Poem 283: The Declaration of London


On the reassembling of Parliament after the Coronation, the Government have no intention of allowing their followers to vote according to their convictions on the Declaration of London, but insist on a strictly party vote.-- Daily Papers



 We were all one heart and one race

   When the Abbey trumpets blew.

 For a moment's breathing-space

   We had forgotten you.

 Now you return to your honoured place

    Panting to shame us anew.


 We have walked with the Ages dead--

    With our Past alive and ablaze.

 And you bid us pawn our honour for bread,

    This day of all the days!

 And you cannot wait till our guests are sped,

    Or last week's wreath decays?


 The light is still in our eyes

    Of Faith and Gentlehood,

 Of Service and Sacrifice;

   And it does not match our mood,

 To turn so soon to your treacheries

   That starve our land of her food.


 Our ears still carry the sound

   Of our once-Imperial seas,

 Exultant after our King was crowned,

   Beneath the sun and the breeze.

 It is too early to have them bound

   Or sold at your decrees.


 Wait till the memory goes,

   Wait till the visions fade,

 We may betray in time, God knows,

   But we would not have it said,

 When you make report to our scornful foes,

   That we kissed as we betrayed!

Poem 285: The Derelict


I was the staunchest of our fleet

       Till the sea rose beneath our feet

    Unheralded, in hatred past all measure.

       Into his pits he stamped my crew,

       Buffeted, blinded, bound and threw,

    Bidding me eyeless wait upon his pleasure.


  Man made me, and my will

  Is to my maker still,

Whom now the currents con, the rollers steer --

  Lifting forlorn to spy

  Trailed smoke along the sky,

Falling afraid lest any keel come near!


  Wrenched as the lips of thirst,

  Wried, dried, and split and burst,

Bone-bleached my decks, wind-scoured to the graining;

  And jarred at every roll

  The gear that was my soul

Answers the anguish of my beams' complaining.


  For life that crammed me full,

  Gangs of the prying gull

That shriek and scrabble on the riven hatches!

  For roar that dumbed the gale,

  My hawse-pipes guttering wail,

Sobbing my heart out through the uncounted watches!


  Blind in the hot blue ring

  Through all my points I swing --

Swing and return to shift the sun anew.

  Blind in my well-known sky

  I hear the stars go by,

Mocking the prow that cannot hold one true!


  White on my wasted path

  Wave after wave in wrath

Frets 'gainst his fellow, warring where to send me.

  Flung forward, heaved aside,

  Witless and dazed I bide

The mercy of the comber that shall end me.


  North where the bergs careen,

  The spray of seas unseen

Smokes round my head and freezes in the falling;

  South where the corals breed,

  The footless, floating weed

Folds me and fouls me, strake on strake upcrawling.


  I that was clean to run

  My race against the sun --

Strength on the deep, am bawd to all disaster --

  Whipped forth by night to meet

  My sister's careless feet,

And with a kiss betray her to my master!


  Man made me, and my will

  Is to my maker still --

To him and his, our peoples at their pier:

  Lifting in hope to spy

  Trailed smoke along the sky,

Falling afraid lest any keel come near!

Poem 286: The Destroyers


The strength of twice three thousand horse

That seeks the single goal;

The line that holds the rending course,

The hate that swings the whole;

The stripped hulls, slinking through the gloom,

At gaze and gone again --

The Brides of Death that wait the groom --

The Choosers of the Slain!


Offshore where sea and skyline blend

 In rain, the daylight dies;

The sullen, shouldering sweels attend

 Night and our sacrifice.

Adown the stricken capes no flare --

 No mark on spit or bar, --

Birdled and desperate we dare

 The blindfold game of war.


Nearer the up-flung beams that spell

 The council of our foes;

Clearer the barking guns that tell

 Their scattered flank to close.

Sheer to the trap they crowd their way

 From ports for this unbarred.

Quiet, and count our laden prey,

 The convoy and her guard!


On shoal with carce a foot below,

 Where rock and islet throng,

Hidden and hushed we watch them throw

 Their anxious lights along.

Not here, not here your danger lies --

 (Stare hard, O hooded eyne!)

Save were the dazed rock-pigeons rise

 The lit cliffs give no sign.


Therefore -- to break the rest ye seek,

 The Narrow Seas to clear --

Hark to the siren's whimpering shriek --

 The driven death is here!

Look to your van a league away, --

 What midnight terror stays

The bulk that checks against the spray

 Her crackling tops ablaze?


Hit, and hard hit! The blow went home,

 The muffled, knocking stroke --

The steam that overruns the foam --

 The foam that thins to smoke --

The smoke that clokes the deep aboil --

 The deep that chokes her throes

Till, streaked with ash and sleeked with oil,

 The lukewarm whirlpools close!


A shadow down the sickened wave

 Long since her slayer fled:

But hear their chattering quick-fires rave

 Astern, abeam, ahead!

Panic that shells the drifting spar --

 Loud waste with none to check --

Mad fear that rakes a scornful star

 Or sweeps a consort's deck.


Now, while their silly smoke hangs thick,

 Now ere their wits they find,

Lay in and lance them to the quick --

 Our gallied whales are blind!

Good luck to those that see end end,

 Good-bye to those that drown --

For each his chance as chance shall send --

 And God for all! Shut down!


The strength of twice three thousand horse

That serve the one command;

The hand that heaves the headlong force,

The hate that backs the hand:

The doom-bolt in the darkness freed,

The mine that splits the main;

The white-hot wake, the 'wildering speed --

The Choosers of the Slain!

Poem 288: The Dove of Dacca


The freed dove flew to the Rajah's tower—

   Fled from the slaughter of Moslem kings—

And the thorns have covered the city of Gaur.

   Dove—dove—oh, homing dove!

Little white traitor, with woe on thy wings!


The Rajah of Dacca rode under the wall;

   He set in his bosom a dove of flight—

`If she return, be sure that I fall."

   Dove—dove—oh, homing dove!

Pressed to his heart in the thick of the fight.


"Fire the palace, the fort, and the keep—

   Leave to the foeman no spoil at all.

In the flame of the palace lie down and sleep

   If the dove—if the dove—if the homing dove

Come, and alone, to the palace wall."


The Kings of the North they were scattered abroad—

   The Rajah of Dacca he slew them all.

Hot from slaughter he stooped at the ford,

   And the dove—the dove—oh, the homing dove!

She thought of her cote on the palace-wall.


She opened her wings and she flew away—

   Fluttered away beyond recall;

She came to the palace at break of day.

   Dove—dove—oh, homing dove,

Flying so fast for a kingdom's fall!


The Queens of Dacca they slept in flame—

   Slept in the flame of the palace old—

To save their honour from Moslem shame.

   And the dove—the dove—oh, the homing dove,

She cooed to her young where the smoke-cloud rolled!


The Rajah of Dacca rode far and fleet,

   Followed as fast as a horse could fly,

He came and the palace was black at his feet;

   And the dove—the dove—the homing dove,

Circled alone in the stainless sky.


So the dove flew to the Rajah's tower—

   Fled from the slaughter of Moslem kings;

So the thorns covered the city of Gaur,

   And Dacca was lost for a white dove's wings.

Dove—dove—oh, homing dove,

   Dacca is lost from the Roll of the Kings!

Poem 289: The Dutch in the Medway


If wars were won by feasting,

   Or victory by song,

Or safety found in sleeping sound,

   How England would be strong!

But honour and dominion

   Are not maintainéd so,

They're only got by sword and shot,

   And this the Dutchmen know!


The moneys that should feed us,

   You spend on your delight,

How can you then have sailor-men

   To aid you in your fight?

Our fish and cheese are rotten,

   Which makes the scurvy grow—

We cannot serve you if we starve,

   And this the Dutchmen know!


Our ships in every harbour

   Be neither whole nor sound,

And, when we seek to mend a leak,

   No oakum can be found,

Or, if it is, the caulkers,

   And carpenters also,

For lack of pay have gone away,

   And this the Dutchmen know!


Mere powder, guns, and bullets,

   We scarce can get at all,

Their price was spent in merriment

   And revel at Whitehall,

While we in tattered doublets

   From ship to ship must row,

Beseeching friends for odds and ends—

   And this the Dutchmen know!


No King will heed our warnings,

   No Court will pay our claims—

Our King and Court for their disport

   Do sell the very Thames!

For, now De Ruyter's topsails,

   Off naked Chatham show,

We dare not meet him with our fleet—

   And this the Dutchmen know!

Poem 291: The Dykes


We have no heart for the fishing, we have no hand for the oar —

All that our fathers taught us of old pleases us now no more;

All that our own hearts bid us believe we doubt where we do not deny —

There is no proof in the bread we eat or rest in the toil we ply.


Look you, our foreshore stretches far through sea-gate, dyke, and groin —

Made land all, that our fathers made, where the flats and the fairway join.

They forced the sea a sea-league back. They died, and their work stood fast.

We were born to peace in the lee of the dykes, but the time of our peace is past.


Far off, the full tide clambers and slips, mouthing and testing all,

Nipping the flanks of the water-gates, baying along the wall;

Turning the shingle, returning the shingle, changing the set of the sand...

We are too far from the beach, men say, to know how the outworks stand.


So we come down, uneasy, to look, uneasily pacing the beach.

These are the dykes our fathers made: we have never known a breach.

Time and again has the gale blown by and we were not afraid;

Now we come only to look at the dykes — at the dykes our fathers made.


O’er the marsh where the homesteads cower apart the harried sunlight flies,

Shifts and considers, wanes and recovers, scatters and sickens and dies —

An evil ember bedded in ash — a spark blown west by the wind...

We are surrendered to night and the sea — the gale and the tide behind!


At the bridge of the lower saltings the cattle gather and blare,

Roused by the feet of running men, dazed by the lantern glare.

Unbar and let them away for their lives—the levels drown as they stand,

Where the flood-wash forces the sluices aback and the ditches deliver inland.


Ninefold deep to the top of the dykes the galloping breakers stride,

And their overcarried spray is a sea — a sea on the landward side.

Coming, like stallions they paw with their hooves, going they snatch with their teeth,

Till the bents and the furze and the sand are dragged out, and the old-time hurdles beneath.


Bid men gather fuel for fire, the tar, the oil and the tow —

Flame we shall need, not smoke, in the dark if the riddled seabanks go.

Bid the ringers watch in the tower (who knows how the dawn shall prove?)

Each with his rope between his feet and the trembling bells above.


Now we can only wait till the day, wait and apportion our shame.

These are the dykes our fathers left, but we would not look to the same.

Time and again were we warned of the dykes, time and again we delayed:

Now, it may fall, we have slain our sons, as our fathers we have betrayed.


Walking along the wreck of the dykes, watching the work of the seas!

These were the dykes our fathers made to our great profit and ease.

But the peace is gone and the profit is gone, with the old sure days withdrawn...

That our own houses show as strange when we come back in the dawn!

Poem 292: The Egg-Shell


The  wind took off with the sunset--

The fog came up with the tide,

When the Witch of the North took an Egg-shell

With a little Blue Devil inside.

"Sink," she said, "or swim," she said,

"It's all you will get from me.

And that is the finish of him!" she said

And the Egg-shell went to sea.

The fog shut down like a sheet,

When the Witch of the North heard the Egg-shell

Feeling by hand for a fleet.

"Get!" she said, "or you're gone," she said.,

But the little Blue Devil said "No!

"The sights are just coming on," he said,

And he let the Whitehead go.


The wind got up with the morning--

The fog blew off with the rain,

When the Witch of the North saw the Egg-shell

And the little Blue Devil again.

"Did you swim?" she said. "Did you sink?" she said,

And the little Blue Devil replied:

"For myself I swam, but I think," he said,

"There's somebody sinking outside."

And what should they know of England who only England know? --

They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag!


Must we borrow a clout from the Boer -- to plaster anew with dirt?

For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath,

Poem 294: The Exiles' Line


Now the new year reviving old desires,

The restless soul to open sea aspires,

Where the Blue Peter flickers from the fore,

And the grimed stoker feeds the engine-fires.

Coupons, alas, depart with all their rows,

And last year's sea-met loves where Grindley knows;

But still the wild wind wakes off Gardafui,

And hearts turn eastward with the P. and O's.


Twelve knots an hour, be they more or less -

Oh slothful mother of much idleness,

Whom neither rivals spur nor contracts speed!

Nay, bear us gently! Wherefore need we press?


The Tragedy of all our East is laid

On those white decks beneath the awning shade -

Birth, absence, longing, laughter, love and tears,

And death unmaking ere the land is made.


And midnight madnesses of souls distraught

Whom the cool seas call through the open port,

So that the table lacks one place next morn,

And for one forenoon men forego their sport.


The shadow of the rigging to and fro

Sways, shifts, and flickers on the spar-deck's snow,

And like a giant trampling in his chains,

The screw-blades gasp and thunder deep below;


And, leagued to watch one flying-fish's wings,

Heaven stoops to sea, and sea to Heaven clings;

While, bent upon the ending of his toil,

The hot sun strides, regarding not these things:


For the same wave that meets our stem in spray

Bore Smith of Asia eastward yesterday,

And Delhi Jones and Brown of Midnapore

To-morrow follow on the self-same way.


Linked in the chain of Empire one by one,

Flushed with long leave, or tanned with many a sun,

The Exiles' Line brings out the exiles line

And ships them homeward when their work is done.


Yea, heedless of the shuttle through the loom,

The flying keels fulfil the web of doom.

Sorrow or shouting; what is that to them?

Make out the cheque that pays for cabin room!


And how so many score of times ye flit

With wife and babe and caravan of kit,

Not all thy travels past shall lower one fare,

Not all thy tears abate one pound of it.


And how so high throe earth-born dignity,

Honour and state, go sink it in the sea,

Till that great one upon the quarter deck,

Brow-bound with gold, shall give thee leave to be.


Indeed, indeed from that same line we swear

Off for all time, and mean it when we swear;

And then, and then we meet the Quartered Flag,

And, surely for the last time, pay the fare.


And Green of Kensington, estray ed to view

In three short months the world he never knew,

Stares with blind eyes upon the Quartered

Flag And sees no more than yellow, red and blue.


But we, the gypsies of the East, but we

Waifs of the land and wastrels of the sea

Come nearer home beneath the Quartered Flag

Than ever home shall come to such as we.


The camp is struck, the bungalow decays,

Dead friends and houses desert mark our ways,

Till sickness send us down to Prince's Dock

To meet the changeless use of many days.


Bound in the wheel of Empire, one by one,

The chain-gangs of the East from sire to son,

The Exiles' Line takes out the exiles line

And ships them homeward when their work is done.


How runs the old indictment? Dear and slow,

So much and twice so much. We gird, but go.

For all the soul of our sad East is there,

Poem 295: The Expert


Youth that trafficked long with Death,

  And to second life returns,

Squanders little time or breath

  On his fellow--man's concerns.

Earned peace is all he asks

To fulfill his broken tasks.


Yet, if he find war at home

  (Waspish and importunate),

He hath means to overcome

  Any warrior at his gate;

For the past he buried brings

Back unburiable things--


Nights that he lay out to spy,

  Whence and when the raid might start;

Or prepared in secrecy

  Sudden blows to break its heart--

All the lore of No-Man's Land

Steels his soul and arms his hand.


So, if conflict vex his life

  Where he thought all conflict done,

He, resuming ancient strife,

  Springs his mine or trains his gun;

And, in mirth more dread than wrath,

Wipes the nuisance from his path!

Poem 296: The Explanation


Love and Death once ceased their strife

At the Tavern of Man's Life.

Called for wine, and threw -- alas! --

Each his quiver on the grass.

When the bout was o'er they found

Mingled arrows strewed the ground.

Hastily they gathered then

Each the loves and lives of men.

Ah, the fateful dawn deceived!

Mingled arrows each one sheaved;

Death's dread armoury was stored

With the shafts he most abhorred;

Love's light quiver groaned beneath

Venom-headed darts of Death.


Thus it was they wrought our woe

At the Tavern long ago.

Tell me, do our masters know,

Loosing blindly as they fly,

Old men love while young men die?

Poem 297: The Explorer


"There's no sense in going further --

it's the edge of cultivation,"

So they said, and I believed it --

broke my land and sowed my crop --

Built my barns and strung my fences

in the little border station

Tucked away below the foothills

where the trails run out and stop.


Till a voice, as bad as Conscience,

rang interminable changes

In one everlasting Whisper

day and night repeated -- so:

"Something hidden. Go and find it.

Go and look behind the Ranges --

Something lost behind the Ranges.

Lost and waiting for you. Go!"


So I went, worn out of patience;

never told my nearest neighbours --

Stole away with pack and ponies --

left 'em drinking in the town;

And the faith that moveth mountains

didn't seem to help my labours

As I faced the sheer main-ranges,

whipping up and leading down.


March by march I puzzled through 'em,

turning flanks and dodging shoulders,

Hurried on in hope of water,

headed back for lack of grass;

Till I camped above the tree-line --

drifted snow and naked boulders --

Felt free air astir to windward --

knew I'd stumbled on the Pass.


'Thought to name it for the finder;

but that night the Norther found me --

Froze and killed the plains-bred ponies;

so I called the camp Despair.

(It's the Railway Cap today, though.)  

Then my whisper waked to hound me:

"Something lost behind the Ranges.

Over yonder! Go you there!"


Then I knew, the while I doubted --

knew His Hand was certain o'er me.

Still -- it might be self-delusion --

scores of better men had died --

I could reach the township living,

but ... He knows what terrors tore me ...

But I didn't ... but I didn't.

I went down the other side.


Till the snow ran out in flowers,

and the flowers turned to aloes,

And the aloes sprung to thickets

and a brimming stream ran by;

But the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub,

and the water drained to shallows,

And I dropped again on

desert-blasted earth and blasting sky ...


I remember lighting fires;

I remember sitting by them;

I remember seeing faces,

hearing voices through the smoke;

I remember they were fancy --

for I threw a stone to try 'em.

"Something lost behind the Ranges"

was the only word they spoke.


I remember going crazy.

I remember that I knew it

When I heard myself hallooing

to the funny folk I saw.

Very full of dreams that desert;

but my two legs took me through it ...

And I used to watch 'em moving

with the toes all black and raw.


But at last the country altered --

White Man's country past disputing --

Rolling grass and open timber,

with a hint of hills behind --

There I found me food and water,

and I lay a week recruiting,

Got my strength and lost my nightmares.

Then I entered on my find.


Thence I ran my first rough survey --

chose my trees and blazed and ringed 'em --

Week by week I pried and sampled --

week by week my findings grew.

Saul, he went to look for donkeys,

and by God he found a kingdom!

But by God, who sent His Whisper,

I had struck the worth of two!


Up along the hostile mountains,

where the hair-poised snowslide shivers --

Down and through the big fat marshes

that the virgin ore-bed stains,

Till I heard the mild-wide mutterings

of unimagined rivers,

And beyond the nameless timber

saw illimitable plains!


Plotted sites of future cities,

traced the easy grades between 'em;

Watched unharnessed rapids wasting

fifty thousand head an hour;

Counted leagues of water frontage

through the axe-ripe woods that screen 'em --

Saw the plant to feed a people --

up and waiting for the power!


Well, I know who'll take the credit --

all the clever chaps that followed --

Came a dozen men together --

never knew my desert fears;

Tracked me by the camps I'd quitted,

used the water holes I'd hollowed.

They'll go back and do the talking.

They'll be called the Pioneers!


They will find my sites of townships --

not the cities that I set there.

They will rediscover rivers --

not my rivers heard at night.

By my own old marks and bearings

they will show me how to get there,

By the lonely cairns I builded

they will guide my feet aright.


Have I named one single river:  

Have I claimed one single acre?

Have I kept one single nugget --

(barring samples?)  No, not I!

Because my price was paid me

ten times over by my Maker.

But you wouldn't understand it.

You go up and occupy.


Ores you'll find there; wood and cattle;

water-transit sure and steady,

(That should keep the railway rates down

coal and iron at your doors.

God took care to hide that country

till He judged His people ready,

Then He chose me for His Whisper,

and I've found it, and it's yours!


Yes, your "never-never country" --

yes, your "edge of cultivation"

And "no sense in going further" --

till I crossed the range to see.

God forgive me! No, I didn't.

It's God's present to our nation.

Anybody might have found it --

but His Whisper came to Me!

Poem 298: The Fabulists


When  all the world would keep a matter hid,

 Since Truth is seldom Friend to any crowd,

Men write  in Fable, as old AEsop did,

 Jesting at that which none will name aloud.

And this they needs must do, or it will fall

Unless they please they are not heard at all.


When desperate Folly  daily laboureth

    To work confusion upon all we have,

When diligent Sloth  demandeth Freedom's  death,

   And banded Fear commandeth Honour's grave--

Even in that certain hour before the fall,

Unless men please they are not heard at all.


Needs must all please, yet some not all for need,

 Needs must all toil, yet some not all for gain,

But that men taking pleasure may take heed

  Whom present toil shall snatch from later pain.

Thus some have toiled, but their reward was small

Since, though they pleased, they were not heard at all.


This was the lock that lay upon our lips,

 This was the yoke that we have undergone,

Denying us all pleasant fellowships

 As in our time and generation.

Our pleasures unpursued age past recall,

And for our pains--we are not heard at all.


What man hears aught except the groaning guns?

   What man heeds aught save what each instant brings?

When each man's life all imaged life outruns,

    What man shall pleasure in imaginings?

So it hath fallen, as it was bound to fall,

We are not, nor we were not, heard at all.

Poem 299: The Fairies' Siege


I have been given my charge to keep--

Well have I kept the same!

Playing with strife for the most of my life,

But this is a different game.

I'll not fight against swords unseen,

Or spears that I cannot view--

Hand him the keys of the place on your knees--

'Tis the Dreamer whose dreams come true!


Ask him his terms and accept them at once.

Quick, ere we anger him, go!

Never before have I flinched from the guns,

But this is a different show.

I'll not fight with the Herald of God

(I know what his Master can do!)

Open the gate, he must enter in state,

'Tis the Dreamer whose dreams come true!


I'd not give way for an Emperor,

I'd hold my road for a King--

To the Triple Crown I would not bow down--

But this is a different thing.

I'll not fight with the Powers of Air,

Sentry, pass him through!

Poem 301: The Feet of the Young Men


Now the Four-way Lodge is opened, now the Hunting Winds are loose --

 Now the Smokes of Spring go up to clear the brain;

Now the Young  Men's hearts are troubled for the whisper of the Trues,

 Now the Red Gods make their medicine again!

Who hath seen the beaver busied? Who hath watched the black-tail mating?

 Who hath lain alone to hear the wild-goose cry'

Who hath worked the chosen water where the ouananiche is waiting,

 Or the sea-trout's jumping-crazy for the fly?


He must go -- go -- go away from here!

On the other side the world he's overdue.

'Send your road is clear before you where the old Spring-fret comes o'er you,

And the Red Gods call for you!


So for one the wet sail arching through the rainbow-round the bow,

 And for one the creak of snow-shoes on the crust;

And for one the lakeside lilies where the bull-moose waits the cow,

 And for one the mule-train coughing in the dust.

Who hath smelt smelt-smoke at twilight? Who hath heard the birch-log burning?

 Who is quick to read the noises of the night?

Let him follow with the others for the Young Men's feet are turning

 Too the camps of proved desire and known delight!


Let him  go -- go, etc.



                              I


Do you know the blackened timber -- do you know that racing stream

 With the raw, right-angled log-jam at the end;

And the bar of sun-warmed shingle where a man may bask and dream

 To the click of shod canoe-poles round the bend'

I is there that we are going with our rods and reels and traces,

 To a silent, smoky Indian that we know --

To a couch of new-pulled hemlock, with the starlight on our faces,

 For the Red Gods call us out and we must go!


They must go -- go, etc.



                             II


Do you know the shallow Baltic where the seas are steep and short,

 Where the bluff, lee-boarded fishing-luggers ride?

Do you know the joy of threshing leagues to leeward of your port

 On a coast you've lost the chart of overside?

It is there that I am going, with an extra hand to bale her --

 Just one able 'long-shore loafer that I know.

He can take his chance of drowning, while I sail and sail and sail her,

 For the Red Gods call me out and I must go!


He must go -- go, etc.

Do you know the pile-built village where the sago-dealers trade --

 Do you know the reek of fish and wet bamboo?

Do you know the steaming stillness of the orchid-scented glade

 When the blazoned, bird-winged butterflies flap through?

It is there that I am going with my camphor, net, and boxes,

 To a gentle, yellow pirate that I know --

To my little wailing lemurs, to my palms and flying-foxes,

 For the Red Gods call me out and I must go!


He must go -- go, etc.

Do you know the world's white roof-tree -- do you know that windy rift

 Where the baffling mountain-eddies chop and change?

Do you know the long day's patience, belly-down on frozen drift,

 While the head of heads is feeding out of range?

It is there that I am going, where the boulders and the snow lie,

 With a trusty, nimble tracker that I know.

I have sworn an oath, to keep it on the Horns of Ovis Poli,

 And the Red Gods call me out and I must go!


He must go -- go, etc.


How the Four-way Lodge is opened -- now the Smokes of Council rise --

 Pleasant smokes, ere yet 'twixt trail and trail they choose --

Now the girths and ropes are tested: now they pack their last supplies:

 Now our Young Men go to dance before the Trues!

Who shall meet them at those altars -- who shall light them to that shrine?

 Velvet-footed, who shall guide them to their goal?

Unto each the voice and vision: unto each his spoor and sign --

Lonely mountain in the Northland, misty sweat-bath 'neath the Line --

 And to each a man that knows his naked soul!


White or yellow, black or copper, he is waiting, as a lover,

 Smoke of funnel, dust of hooves, or beat of train --

Where the high grass hides the horseman or the glaring flats discover --

Where the steamer hails the landing, or the surf-boat brings the rover --

Where the rails run out in sand-rift . . . Quick! ah, heave the camp-kit over,  

 For the Red Gods make their medicine again!


And we go -- go -- go away from here!

On the other side the world we're overdue!

'Send the road is clear before you when the old Spring-fret comes o'er you,

Poem 302: The Female of the Species


When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride,

He shouts to scare the monster who will often turn aside.

But the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail,

For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.


When Nag, the wayside cobra, hears the careless foot of man,

He will sometimes wriggle sideways and avoid it if he can,

But his mate makes no such motion where she camps beside the trail -

For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.


When the early Jesuit fathers preached to Hurons and Choctaws,

They prayed to be delivered from the vengeance of the squaws -

'Twas the women, not the warriors, turned those stark enthusiasts pale -

For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.


Man's timid heart is bursting with the things he must not say,

For the Woman that God gave him isn't his to give away;

But when hunter meets with husband, each confirms the others tale -

The female of the species is more deadly than the male.


Man, a bear in most relations, worm and savage otherwise,

Man propounds negotiations, Man accepts the compromise;

Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact

To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act.


Fear, or foolishness, impels him, ere he lay the wicked low,

To concede some form of trial even to his fiercest foe.

Mirth obscene diverts his anger; Doubt and Pity oft perplex

Him in dealing with an issue - to the scandal of the Sex!


But the Woman that God gave him, every fibre of her frame

Proves her launched for one sole issue, armed and engined for the same,

And to serve that single issue, lest the generations fail,

The female of the species must be deadlier than the male.


She who faces Death by torture for each life beneath her breast

May not deal in doubt or pity - must not swerve for fact or jest.

These be purely male diversions - not in these her honor dwells -

She, the Other Law we live by, is that Law and nothing else!


She can bring no more to living than the powers that make her great

As the Mother of the Infant and the Mistress of the Mate;

And when Babe and Man are lacking and she strides unclaimed to claim

Her right as femme (and baron), her equipment is the same.


She is wedded to convictions - in default of grosser ties;

Her contentions are her children, Heaven help him, who denies!

He will meet no cool discussion, but the instant, white-hot wild

Wakened female of the species warring as for spouse and child.


Unprovoked and awful charges - even so the she-bear fights;

Speech that drips, corrodes and poisons - even so the cobra bites;

Scientific vivisection of one nerve till it is raw,

And the victim writhes with anguish - like the Jesuit with the squaw!


So it comes that Man, the coward, when he gathers to confer

With his fellow-braves in council, dare not leave a place for her

Where, at war with Life and Conscience, he uplifts his erring hands

To some God of abstract justice - which no woman understands.


And Man knows it! Knows, moreover, that the Woman that God gave him

Must command but may not govern; shall enthrall but not enslave him.

And She knows, because She warns him and Her instincts never fail,

That the female of Her species is more deadly than the male!

Poem 303: The Files


Files

The Files -

Office Files !

Oblige me by referring to the Files.

Every question man can raise,

Every phrase of every phrase

Of that question is on record in the Files -

(Threshed out threadbare - fought and finished in the Files

Ere the Universe at large

Was our new-tipped arrows' targe -

Ere we rediscovered Mammon and his wiles

Faeza gentle reader, spent her-five-and-twentieth leader

(You will find him, and some others, in the Files).

Warn all coming Robert Brownings and Carlyles,

It will interest them to hunt among the Files

Where unvisited, a-cold,

Lie the crowded years of old

In that Kensal-Green of greatness called the Files

(In our newspaPère-la-Chaise the Office Files),

Where the dead men lay them down

Meekly sure of long renown,

And above them, sere and swift,

Packs the daily deepening drift

Of the all-recording, all-effacing Files

The obliterating, automatic Files.

Count the mighty men who slung

Ink, Evangel, Sword, or Tongue

When Reform and you were young

Made their boasts and spake according in the Files

(Hear the ghosts that wake applauding in the Files!)

Trace each all-forgot career

From long primer through brevier

Unto Death, a para minion in the Files

(Para minion-solid-bottom of the Files). . . .

Some successful Kings and Queens adorn the Files.

They were great, their views were leaded,

And their deaths were triple-headed,

So they catch the eye in running through the Files

(Show as blazes in the mazes of the Files);

For their "paramours and priests,"

And their gross, jack-booted feasts,

And their "epoch-marking actions" see the Files.

Was it Bomba fled the blue Sicilian isles?

Was it Saffi, a professor

Once of Oxford, brought redress or

Garibaldi? Who remembers

Forty-odd-year-old Septembers? -

Only sextons paid to dig among the Files (Such as I am, born and bred among the Files).

You must hack through much deposit

Ere you know for sure who was it

Came to burial with such honour in the Files (Only seven seasons back beneath the Files).

"Very great our loss and grievous - "So our best and brightest leave us,

"And it ends the Age of Giants," say the Files;

All the '60-'70-'80'-'90 Files

(The open-minded, opportunist Files ?

The easy " 0 King, live for ever " Files).

It is good to read a little in the Files;

'Tis a sure and sovereign balm

Unto philosophic calm,

Yea, and philosophic doubt when Life beguiles

When you know Success is Greatness,

When you marvel at your lateness

In apprehending facts so plain to Smiles

(Self-helpful, wholly strenuous Samuel Smiles).

When your Imp of Blind Desire

Bids you set the Thames afire,

You'll remember men have done so - in the Files.

You'll have seen those flames transpire - in the Files

(More than once that flood has run so - in the Files).

When the Conchimarian horns

Of the reboantic Norns

Usher gentlemen and ladies

With new lights on Heaven and Hades,

Guaranteeing to Eternity

All yesterday's modernity;

When Brocken-spectres made by

Some one's breath on ink parade by,

Very earnest and tremendous,

Let not shows of shows offend us.

When of everything we like we

Shout ecstatic: " Quod ubique,

"Quod ab omnibus means semper!

Oh, my brother, keep your temper!

Light your pipe and take a look along the Files.

You've a better chance to guess

At the meaning of Success

(Which is Greatness - vide Press)

When you've seen it in perspective in the Files !

Poem 304: The Fires


Men make them fires on the hearth

 Each under his roof-tree,

And the Four Winds that rule the earth

 They blow the smoke to me.


Across the high hills and the sea

 And all the changeful skies,

The Four Winds blow the smoke to me

 Till the tears are in my eyes.


Until the tears are in my eyes.

 And my heart is wellnigh broke

For thinking on old memories

 That gather in the smoke.


With every shift of every wind

 The homesick memories come,

From every quarter of mankind

 Where I have made me a home.


Four times a fire against the cold

 And a roof against the rain --

Sorrow fourfold and joy fourfold

 The Four Winds bring again!


How can I answer which is best

 Of all the fires that burn?

I have been too often host or guest

 At every fire in turn.


How can I turn from any fire,

 On any man's hearthstone?

I know the wonder and desire

 That went to build my own!


How can I doubt man's joy or woe

 Where'er his house-fires shine.

Since all that man must undergo

 Will visit me at mine?


Oh, you Four Winds that blow so strong

 And know that his is true,

Stoop for a little and carry my song

 To all the men I knew!


Where there are fires against the cold,

 Or roofs against the rain --

With love fourfold and joy fourfold,

 Take them my songs again!

Poem 305: The First Chantey


Mine was the woman to me, darkling I found her;

Haling her dumb from the camp, took her and bound her.

Hot rose her tribe on our track ere I had proved her;

Hearing her laugh in the gloom, greatly I loved her.


Swift through the forest we ran; none stood to guard us,

Few were my people and far; then the flood barred us --

Him we call Son of the Sea, sullen and swollen.

Panting we waited the death, stealer and stolen.


Yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter,

Lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water;

Holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her,

Called she the God of the Wind that He should aid her.


Life had the tree at that word (Praise we the Giver!)

Otter-like left he the bank for the full river.

Far fell their axes behind, flashing and ringing,

Wonder was on me and fear -- yet she was singing!


Low lay the land we had left.  Now the blue bound us,

Even the Floor of the Gods level around us.

Whisper there was not, nor word, shadow nor showing,

Till the light stirred on the deep, glowing and growing.


Then did He leap to His place flaring from under,

He the Compeller, the Sun, bared to our wonder.

Nay, not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing,

Cleared He the gate of the world, huge and amazing!


This we beheld (and we live) -- the Pit of the Burning!

Then the God spoke to the tree for our returning;

Back to the beach of our flight, fearless and slowly,

Back to our slayers went he:  but we were holy.


Men that were hot in that hunt, women that followed,

Babes that were promised our bones, trembled and wallowed:

Over the necks of the Tribe crouching and fawning --

Prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning!

Poem 306: The Flight


When the grey geese heard the Fool's tread

  Too near to where they lay,

They lifted neither voice nor head,

 But took themselves away.


No water broke, no pinion whirred-

 There went no warning call.

The steely, sheltering rushes stirred

 A little--that was all.


Only the osiers understood,

 And the drowned meadows spied

What else than wreckage of a flood

  Stole outward on that tide.


But the far beaches saw their ranks

 Gather and greet and grow

By myriads on the naked banks

 Watching their sign to go;


Till, with a roar of wings that churned

 The shivering shoals to foam,

Flight after flight took air and turned  -

To find a safer home;


And  far below their steadfast wedge,

 They heard (and hastened on)

Men thresh and clamour through the sedge

 Aghast that they were gone!


And, when men prayed them come anew

 And nest where they were bred,

"Nay, fools foretell what knaves will do,"

 Was all the grey geese said.

Poem 307: The Floods


The rain it rains without a stay

  In the hills above us, in the hills;

And presently the floods break way

 Whose strength is in the hills.

The trees they suck from every cloud,

The valley brooks they roar aloud--

Bank-high for the lowlands, lowlands,

 Lowlands under the hills!


The first wood down is sere and small,

 From the hills--the brishings off the hills;

And then come by the bats and all

 We cut last year in the hills;

And then the roots we tried to cleave

But found too tough and had to leave--

Polting through the lowlands, lowlands,

  Lowlands under the hills!


The eye shall look, the ear shall hark

  To the hills, the doings in the hills,

And rivers mating in the dark

  With tokens from the hills.

Now what is weak will! surely go,

And what is strong must prove it so--

Stand Fast in the lowlands, lowlands,

  Lowlands under the hills!


The floods they shall not be afraid--

   Nor the hills above 'em, nor the hills--

Of any fence which man has made

   Betwixt him and the hills.

The waters shall not reckon twice

 For any work of man's device,

 But bid it down to the lowlands, lowlands,

    Lowlands under the hills!


 The floods shall sweep corruption clean--

    By the hills, the blessing of the hills--

 That more the meadows may be green

    New-mended from the hills.

 The crops and cattle shall increase,

 Nor little children shall not cease.

 Go--plough the lowlands, lowlands,

    Lowlands under the hills!

Poem 308: The Flowers


To our private taste, there is always something a little exotic,

    almost artificial, in songs which, under an English aspect and dress,

    are yet so manifestly the product of other skies.  They affect us

    Buy my heath and lilies

    And I'll tell you whence you hail!

Under hot Constantia broad the vineyards lie --

Throned and thorned the aching berg props the speckless sky --

Slow below the Wynberg firs trails the tilted wain --

Take the flower and turn the hour, and kiss your love again!


    Buy my English posies!

    You that will not turn --

    Buy my hot-wood clematis,

    Buy a frond o' fern

    Gathered where the Erskine leaps

    Down the road to Lorne --

    Buy my Christmas creeper

    And I'll say where you were born!

West away from Melbourne dust holidays begin --

They that mock at Paradise woo at Cora Lynn --

Through the great South Otway gums sings the great South Main --

Take the flower and turn the hour, and kiss your love again!


    Buy my English posies!

    Here's your choice unsold!

    Buy a blood-red myrtle-bloom,

    Buy the kowhai's gold

    Flung for gift on Taupo's face,

    Sign that spring is come --

    Buy my clinging myrtle

    And I'll give you back your home!

Broom behind the windy town; pollen o' the pine --

Bell-bird in the leafy deep where the ~ratas~ twine --

Fern above the saddle-bow, flax upon the plain --

Take the flower and turn the hour, and kiss your love again!


    Buy my English posies!

    Ye that have your own

    Buy them for a brother's sake

    Overseas, alone.

    Weed ye trample underfoot

    Floods his heart abrim --

    Bird ye never heeded,

    Oh, she calls his dead to him!

Far and far our homes are set round the Seven Seas;

Woe for us if we forget, we that hold by these!

Unto each his mother-beach, bloom and bird and land --

Masters of the Seven Seas, oh, love and understand.

Poem 309: The Four Angels


As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree

The Angel of the Earth came down, and offered Earth in fee;

   But Adam did not need it,

   Nor the plough he would not speed it,

Singing: --"Earth and Water, Air and Fire,

   What more can mortal man desire?"

       (The Apple Tree's in bud)


As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree

The Angel of the Waters offered all the Seas in fee;

   But Adam would not take 'em,

   Nor the ships he wouldn't make 'em,

Singing:--"Water, Earth and Air and Fire,

   What more can mortal man desire? "

       (The Apple Tree's in leaf.)


As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree

The Angel of the Air he offered all the Air in fee;

    But Adam did not crave it,

    Nor the flight he wouldn't brave it,

Singing: --"Air and Water, Earth and Fire,

    What more can mortal man desire:"

       (The Apple Tree's in bloom.)


As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree

The Angel of the Fire rose up and not a word said he;

    But he wished a flame and made it,

    And in Adam's heart he laid it,

 Singing: --"Fire, Fire, burning Fire!

    Stand up, and reach your heart's desire!"

       (The Apple Blossom's set.)


As Adam was a-working outside of Eden-Wall,

He used the Earth, he used the Seas, he used the Air and all;

    Till out of black disaster

    He arose to be a master

     Of Earth and Water, Air and Fire,

     But never reached his heart's desire!

       (The Apple Tree's cut down!)

Poem 311: The French Wars


Napoleonic



The boats of Newhaven and Folkestone and Dover

To Dieppe and Boulogne and to Calais cross over;

And in each of those runs there is not a square yard

Where the English and French haven't fought and fought hard!


If the ships that were sunk could be floated once more,

They'd stretch like a raft from the shore to the shore,

And we'd see, as we crossed, every pattern and plan

Of ship that was built since sea-fighting began.


There'd be biremes and brigantines, cutters and sloops,

Cogs, carracks and galleons with gay gilded poops--

Hoys, caravels, ketches, corvettes and the rest,

As thick as regattas, from Ramsgate to Brest.


But the galley's of Caesar, the squadrons of Sluys,

And Nelson's crack frigates are hid from our eyes,

Where the high Seventy-fours of Napoleon's days

Lie down with Deal luggers and French chasse-marees.


They'll answer no signal--they rest on the ooze,

With their honey-combed guns and their skeleton crews--

And racing above them, through sunshine or gale,

The Cross-Channel packets come in with the Mail.


Then the poor sea-sick passengers, English and French,

Must open their trunks on. the Custom-house bench,

While the officers rummage for smuggled cigars

And nobody thinks of our blood-thirsty wars!

Poem 312: The Galley-Slave


Oh gallant was our galley from her caren steering-wheel

To her figurehead of silver and her beak of hammered steel;

The leg-bar chafed the ankle and we gasped for cooler air,

But no galley on the waters with our galley could compare!


Our bulkheads bulged with cotton and our masts were stepped in gold --

We ran a mighty merchandise of niggers in the hold;

The white foam spun behind us, and the black shark swam below,

As we gripped the kicking sweep-head and we made the galley go.


It was merry in the galley, for we revelled now and then --

If they wore us down like cattle, faith, we fought and loved like men!

As we snatched her through the water, so we snatched a minute's bliss,

And the mutter of the dying never spoiled the lover's kiss.


Our women and our children toiled beside us in the dark --

They died, we filed their fetters, and we heaved them to the shark --

We heaved them to the fishes, but so fast the galley sped

We had only time to envy, for we could not mourn our dead.


Bear witness, once my comrades, what a hard-bit gang were we --

The servants of the sweep-head, but the masters of the sea!

By the hands that drove her forward as she plunged and yawed and sheered,

Woman, Man, or god or Devil, was there anything we feared?


Was it storm? Our fathers faced it and a wilder never blew;

Earth that waited for the wreckage watched the galley struggle through.

Burning noon or choking midnight, Sickness, Sorrow, Parting, Death?

Nay, our very babes would mock you had they time for idle breath.


But to-day I leave the galley and another takes my place;

There's my name upon the deck-beam -- let it stand a little space.

I am free -- to watch my messmates beating out to open main,

Free of all that Life can offer -- save to handle sweep again.


By the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall of clinging steel,

By the welt the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal;

By eyes grown old with staring through the sunwash on the brine,

I am paid in full for service. Would that service still were mine!


f times and seasons and of woe the years bring forth,

Of our galley swamped and shattered in the rollers of the North.

When the niggers break the hatches and the decks are gay with gore,

And a craven-hearted pilot crams her crashing on the shore,


She will need no half-mast signal, minute-gun, or rocket-flare,

When the cry for help goes seaward, she will find her servants there.

Battered chain-gangs of the orlop, grizzled drafts of years gone by,

To the bench that broke their manhood, they shall lash themselves and die.


Hale and crippled, young and aged, paid, deserted, shipped away --

Palace, cot, and lazaretto shall make up the tale that day,

When the skies are black above them, and the decks ablaze beneath,

And the top-men clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth.


It may be that Fate will give me life and leave to row once more --

Set some strong man free for fighting as I take awhile his oar.

But to-day I leave the galley. Shall I curse her service then?

God be thanked! Whate'er comes after, I have lived and toiled with Men!

Poem 313: The Gift Of The Sea


The dead child lay in the shroud,

And the widow watched beside;

And her mother slept, and the Channel swept

The gale in the teeth of the tide.


But the mother laughed at all.

"I have lost my man in the sea,

And the child is dead.  Be still," she said,

"What more can ye do to me?"


The widow watched the dead,

And the candle guttered low,

And she tried to sing the Passing Song

That bids the poor soul go.


And "Mary take you now," she sang,

"That lay against my heart."

And "Mary smooth your crib to-night,"

But she could not say "Depart."


Then came a cry from the sea,

But the sea-rime blinded the glass,

And "Heard ye nothing, mother?" she said,

"'Tis the child that waits to pass."


And the nodding mother sighed.

"'Tis a lambing ewe in the whin,

For why should the christened soul cry out

That never knew of sin?"


"O feet I have held in my hand,

O hands at my heart to catch,

How should they know the road to go,

And how should they lift the latch?"


They laid a sheet to the door,

With the little quilt atop,

That it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt,

But the crying would not stop.


The widow lifted the latch

And strained her eyes to see,

And opened the door on the bitter shore

To let the soul go free.


There was neither glimmer nor ghost,

There was neither spirit nor spark,

And "Heard ye nothing, mother?" she said,

"'Tis crying for me in the dark."


And the nodding mother sighed:

"'Tis sorrow makes ye dull;

Have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern,

Or the wail of the wind-blown gull?"


"The terns are blown inland,

The gray gull follows the plough.

'Twas never a bird, the voice I heard,

O mother, I hear it now!"


"Lie still, dear lamb, lie still;

The child is passed from harm,

'Tis the ache in your breast that broke your rest,

And the feel of an empty arm."


She put her mother aside,

"In Mary's name let be!

For the peace of my soul I must go," she said,

And she went to the calling sea.


In the heel of the wind-bit pier,

Where the twisted weed was piled,

She came to the life she had missed by an hour,

For she came to a little child.


She laid it into her breast,

And back to her mother she came,

But it would not feed and it would not heed,

Though she gave it her own child's name.


And the dead child dripped on her breast,

And her own in the shroud lay stark;

And "God forgive us, mother," she said,

"We let it die in the dark!"

Poem 314: The Gipsy Trail


The white moth to the closing bine,

 The bee to the opened clover,

And the gipsy blood to the gipsy blood

 Ever the wide world over.


Ever the wide world over, lass,

 Ever the trail held true,

Over the world and under the world,

 And back at the last to you.


Out of the dark of the gorgio camp,

 Out of the grime and the gray

(Morning waits at the end of the world),

 Gipsy, come away!


The wild boar to the sun-dried swamp

 The red crane to her reed,

And the Romany lass to the Romany lad,

 By the tie of a roving breed.


The pied snake to the rifted rock,

 The buck to the stony plain,

And the Romany lass to the Romany lad,

 And both to the road again.


Both to the road again, again!

 Out on a clean sea-track --

Follow the cross of the gipsy trail

 Over the world and back!


Follow the Romany patteran

  North where the blue bergs sail,

And the bows are grey with the frozen spray,

  And the masts are shod with mail.


Follow the Romany patteran

 Sheer to the Austral Light,

Where the besom of God is the wild South wind,

 Sweeping the sea-floors white.


Follow the Romany patteran

 West to the sinking sun,

Till the junk-sails lift through the houseless drift.

 And the east and west are one.


Follow the Romany patteran

 East where the silence broods

By a purple wave on an opal beach

 In the hush of the Mahim woods.


"The wild hawk to the wind-swept sky,

 The deer to the wholesome wold,

And the heart of a man to the heart of a maid,

 As it was in the days of old."


The heart of a man to the heart of a maid --

 Light of my tents, be fleet.

Morning waits at the end of the world,

 And the world is all at our feet!

Poem 315: The Glory of the Garden


Our England is a garden that is full of stately views,


Of borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues,


With statues on the terraces and peacocks strutting by;


But the Glory of the Garden lies in more than meets the eye.



For where the thick laurels grow, along the thin red wall,


You will find the tool- and potting-sheds which are the heart of all;


The cold-frames and the hot-houses, the dungpits and the tanks,


The rollers, carts and drain-pipes, with the barrows and the planks.



And there you'll see the gardners, the men and 'prentice boys


Told off to do as they are bid and to it without noise;


For, except when seeds are planted and we shout to scare the birds,


The Glory of the Garden it abideth not in words.



And some can pot begonias and some can bud a rose,


And some are hardly fit to trust with anything that grows;


But they can roll and trim the lawns and sift the sand and loam,


For the Glory of the Garden occupieth all who come.



Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made


By singing:--"Oh, how beautiful!" and sitting in the shade,


While better men than we go out and start their working lives


At grubbing weeds from gravel-paths with broken dinner-knives.



There's not a pair of legs so thin, there's not a head so thick,


There's not a hand so weak and white, nor yet a heart so sick,


But it can find some needful job that's crying to be done,


For the Glory of the Garden glorifieth every one.



Then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders,


It it's only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;


And when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,


You will find yourself a partner in the Glory of the Garden.



Oh, Adam was a gardener, and God who made him sees


That half a proper gardener's work is done upon his knees,


So when your work is finished, you can wash your hands and pray


For the Glory of the Garden, that it may not pass away!


For the Glory of the Garden, that it may not pass away!

Poem 316: The Gods of the Copybook Headings


As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,

I Make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market-Place.

Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.


We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn

That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:

But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,

So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.


We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,

Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market-Place.

But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come

That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.


With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch

They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch

They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings.

So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.


When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.

They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.

But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,

And the Gods of the Copybook Heading said: "Stick to the Devil you know."


On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life

(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)

Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "The Wages of Sin is Death."


In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,

By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;

But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "If you don't work you die."


Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew,

And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true

That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four --

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.


            *   *   *   *   *


As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man --

There are only four things certain since Social Progress began --

That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mice,

And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire --

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins

When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins

As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn

The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

Poem 317: The Grave of the Hundred Heads


There's a widow in sleepy Chester

 Who weeps for her only son;

There's a grave on the Pabeng River,

 A grave that the Burmans shun,

And there's Subadar Prag Tewarri

 Who tells how the work was done.


A Snider squibbed in the jungle,

 Somebody laughed and fled,

And the men of the First Shikaris

 Picked up their Subaltern dead,

With a big blue mark in his forehead

 And the back blown out of his head.


Subadar Prag Tewarri,

 Jemadar Hira Lal,

Took command of the party,

 Twenty rifles in all,

Marched them down to the river

 As the day was beginning to fall.


They buried the boy by the river,

 A blanket over his face --

They wept for their dead Lieutenant,

 The men of an alien race --

They made a samadh in his honor,

 A mark for his resting-place.


For they swore by the Holy Water,

 They swore by the salt they ate,

That the soul of Lieutenant Eshmitt Sahib

 Should go to his God in state;

With fifty file of Burman

 To open him Heaven's gate.


The men of the First Shikaris

 Marched till the break of day,

Till they came to the rebel village,

 The village of Pabengmay --

A jingal covered the clearing,

 Calthrops hampered the way.


Subadar Prag Tewarri,

 Bidding them load with ball,

Halted a dozen rifles

 Under the village wall;

Sent out a flanking-party

 With Jemadar Hira Lal.


The men of the First Shikaris

 Shouted and smote and slew,

Turning the grinning jingal

 On to the howling crew.

The Jemadar's flanking-party

 Butchered the folk who flew.


Long was the morn of slaughter,

 Long was the list of slain,

Five score heads were taken,

 Five score heads and twain;

And the men of the First Shikaris

 Went back to their grave again,


Each man bearing a basket

 Red as his palms that day,

Red as the blazing village --

 The village of Pabengmay,

And the "drip-drip-drip" from the baskets

 Reddened the grass by the way.


They made a pile of their trophies

 High as a tall man's chin,

Head upon head distorted,

 Set in a sightless grin,

Anger and pain and terror

 Stamped on the smoke-scorched skin.


Subadar Prag Tewarri

 Put the head of the Boh

On the top of the mound of triumph,

 The head of his son below,

With the sword and the peacock-banner

 That the world might behold and know.


Thus the samadh was perfect,

 Thus was the lesson plain

Of the wrath of the First Shikaris --

 The price of a white man slain;

And the men of the First Shikaris

 Went back into camp again.


Then a silence came to the river,

 A hush fell over the shore,

And Bohs that were brave departed,

 And Sniders squibbed no more;

   For he Burmans said

   That a kullah's head

Must be paid for with heads five score.


There's a widow in sleepy Chester

 Who weeps for her only son;

There's a grave on the Pabeng River,

 A grave that the Burmans shun,

And there's Subadar Prag Tewarri

 Who tells how the work was done.

While thy raiment was dyed

 In the blood of the Greeks.

 With impetuous breath

Poem 319: The Heritage


Our Fathers in a wondrous age,

     Ere yet the Earth was small,

    Ensured to us a heritage,

      And doubted not at all                  

    That  we  the children of their heart,

      Which then did beat so high,

    In later rime should play like part

      For our posterity.


    A thousand years they steadfast built,

      To 'vantage us and ours,

    The Walls that were a world's despair,

      The sea-constraining Towers:

    Yet in their midmost pride they knew,

      And unto Kings made known,

    Not all from these their strength they drew,

      Their faith from brass or stone.


    Youth's passion, manhood's fierce intent,

      With age's judgment wise,

    They spent, and counted not they spent,

      At daily sacrifice.

    Not lambs alone nor purchased doves        .

      Or tithe of trader's gold--

    Their lives most dear, their dearer loves,

      They offered up of old.


    Refraining e'en from lawful things,

      They bowed the neck to bear

    The unadorned yoke that brings

      Stark toil and sternest care.

    Wherefore through them is Freedom sure;

      Wherefore through them we stand,

    From all but sloth and pride secure,

      In a delightsome land.


    Then, fretful, murmur not they gave

      So great a charge to keep,

    Nor dream that awestruck Time shall save

      Their labour while we sleep.

    Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year,

      Our fathers' title runs.

    Make we likewise their sacrifice,

      Defrauding not our sons.

Poem 320: The Holy War


A tinker out of Bedford,

A vagrant oft in quod,

A privet under Fairfax,

A minister of God--


Two hundred years and thirty

 Ere Armageddon came

His single hand portrayed it,

 And Bunyan was his name!


He mapped for those who follow,

 The world in which we are--

"This famous town of Mansoul"

 That takes the Holy War.

Her true and traitor people,

 The gates along her wall,

From Eye Gate unto Feel Gate,

 John Bunyan showed them all.


All enemy divisions,

 Recruits of every class,

And highly-screened positions

 For flame or poison-gas;

The craft that we call modern,

 The crimes that we call new,

John Bunyan had 'em typed and filed

 In sixteen Eighty-two.


Likewise the Lords of Looseness

 That hamper faith and works,

The Perseverance-Doubters,

 And Present-Comfort shirks,

With brittle intellectuals

 Who crack beneath a strain--

John Bunyan met that helpful set

 In Charles the Second's reign.


Emmanuel's vanguard dying

 For right and not for rights,

My Lord Apollyon lying

 To the State-kept Stockholmites,

The Pope,  the swithering Neutrals

 The Kaiser and his Gott--

Their roles,  their goals, their naked souls--

 He knew and drew the lot.


Now he hath left his quarters,

 In Bunhill Fields to lie,

The wisdom that he taught us

 Is proven prophecy--

One watchword through our Armies,

 One answer from our Lands:--

"No dealings with Diabolus

 As long as Mansoul stands!"


A pedlar from a hovel,

 The lowest of the low,

The Father of the Novel,

 Salvation's first Defoe,

Eight blinded generations

 Ere Armageddon came,

He showed us how to meet it,

 And Bunyan was his name!

Will spring on us, for the first time, the test

  Up to the limit of our years and dower

Of judgment--or beyond. But here we have

Prepared long since our garland or our grave.


  For, at that hour, the sum of all our past,

  Act, habit, thought, and passion, shall be cast

  In one addition, be it more or less,

  And as that reading runs so shall we do;

  Meeting, astounded, victory at the last,

'Twixt my house and thy house what talk can there be

After the burial-parties leave

 And the baffled kites have fled;

The wise hyaenas come out at eve

 To take account of our dead.


How he died and why he died

 Troubles them not a whit.

They snout the bushes and stones aside

 And dig till they come to it.


They are only resolute they shall eat

 That they and their mates may thrive,

And they know that the dead are safer meat

 Than the weakest thing alive.


(For a goat may butt, and a worm may sting,

 And a child will sometimes stand;

But a poor dead soldier of the King

 Can never lift a hand.)


They whoop and halloo and scatter the dirt

 Until their tushes white

 Take good hold in the army shirt,

 And tug the corpse to light,


And the pitiful face is shewn again

 For an instant ere they close;

But it is not discovered to living men --

 Only to God and to those


Who, being soulless, are free from shame,

 Whatever meat they may find.

Nor do they defile the dead man's name --

 That is reserved for his kind.

Through certain hours which in our sight

 Exceed a thousand years:


Thine is the thickness of the Dark

 That presses in our pain,

As Thine the Dawn that bids us mark

 Life's grinning face again.


Thine is the weariness outworn

 No promise shall relieve,

That says at eve, "Would God 'twere morn"

 At morn, "Would God 'twere eve!"


And when Thy tender mercies cease

 And life unvexed is due,

Instant upon the false release

The Worm and Fire renew.


Wherefore we praise Thee in the deep,

 And on our beds we pray

For Thy return that Thou may'st keep

Poem 326: The Instructor


At times when under cover I 'ave said,

To keep my spirits up an' raise a laugh,

'Earin 'im pass so busy over-'ead--

Old Nickel-Neck, 'oo is n't on the Staff --

"There's one above is greater than us all"


Before 'im I 'ave seen my Colonel fall,

An 'watched 'im write my Captain's epitaph,

So that a long way off it could be read--

He 'as the knack o' makin' men feel small--

Old Whistle Tip, 'oo is n't on the Staff.


There is no sense in fleein'' (I 'ave fled),

Better go on an' do the belly-crawl,

An' 'ope' 'e '1l it some other man instead

Of you 'e seems to 'unt so speshual--

Fitzy van Spitz, 'oo is n't on the Staff.


An' thus in mem'ry's cinematograph,

Now that the show is over, I recall

The peevish voice an' 'oary mushroom 'ead

Of  'im we owned was greater than us all,

'Oo give instruction to the quick an' the dead--

The Shudderin'' Beggar--not upon the Staff!

Poem 327: The Inventor


Time and Space decreed his lot,

 But little Man was quick to note:

When Time and Space said Man might not,

 Bravely he answered, "Nay! I mote."


I looked on old New England.

 Time and Space stood fast.

Men built altars to Distance

 At every mile they passed.


Yet sleek with oil, a Force was hid

Making mock of all they did,

Ready at the appointed hour

 To yield up to Prometheus

The secular and well-drilled Power

 The Gods secreted thus.


And over high Wantastiquer

 Emulous my lightnings ran,

Unregarded but after,

  To fall in with my plan.


I beheld two ministries,

 One of air and one of earth--

At a thought I married these,

 And my New Age came to birth!


For rarely my purpose errs

 Though oft it seems to pause,

And rods and cylinders

 Obey my planets' laws.


Oil I drew from the well,

 And Franklin's spark from its blue;

Time and Distance fell,

 And Man went forth anew.


On the prairie and in the street

 So long as my chariots roll

I bind wings to Adam's feet,

 And, presently, to his soul!

Poem 328: The Irish Guards


We're not so old in the Army List,

 But we're not so young at our trade,

For we had the honour at Fontenoy

 Of meeting the Guards' Brigade.

'Twas Lally, Dillon, Bulkeley, Clare,

 And Lee that led us then,

And after a hundred and seventy years

 We're fighting for France again!

Old Days! The wild geese are flighting,

      Head to fhe sform as they faced if before !

   For where there are Irish there's bound to be fighting,

      And when there's no fighting, it's Ireland no more!

                                         Ireland no more!


The fashion's all for khaki now,

 But once through France we went

Full-dressed in scarlet Army cloth,

 The English-left at Ghent.

They're fighting on our side to-day

 But, before they changed their clothes,

The half of Europe knew our fame,

 As all of Ireland knows!

Old Days! The wild geese are flying,

      Head to the sform as they faced it before!

   For where there are Irish there's memory undying,

     And when we forget, it is Ireland no more!

                               Ireland no more!


From Barry Wood to Gouzeaucourt,

 From Boyne to Pilkem Ridge,

The ancient days come back no more

 Than water under the bridge.

But the bridge it stands and the water runs

 As red as yesterday,

And the Irish move to the sound of the guns

 Like salmon to the sea.

 Old Days! The wild geese are ranging,

      Head to fhe storm as they faced it before!

   For where there are Irish their hearts are unchanging,

      And when they are changed, it is Ireland no more!

                                       Ireland no more!


We're not so old in the Army List,

 But we're not so new in the ring,

For we carried our packs with Marshal Saxe

 When Louis was our King.

But Douglas Haig's our Marshal now

 And we're King George's men,        

And after one hundred and seventy years

 We're fighting for France again!

Ah, France! And did we stand by you,

     When life was made splendid with gifts and rewards?

  Ah, France! And will we deny you

     In the hour of your agony, Mother of Swords?

  Old Days! The wild geese are flighing,    

     Head to the storm as they faced it before!

  For where there are Irish there's loving and fighting

     And when we stop either, it's Ireland no more!

                                   Ireland no more!

Poem 329: The Jacket


Through the Plagues of Egyp' we was chasin' Arabi,

Gettin' down an' shovin' in the sun;

An' you might 'ave called us dirty, an' you might ha' called us dry,

An' you might 'ave 'eard us talkin' at the gun.

But the Captain 'ad 'is jacket, an' the jacket it was new --

('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)

An' the wettin' of the jacket is the proper thing to do,

Nor we didn't keep 'im waitin' very long.


One day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt,

Loadin' down the axle-arms with case;

But the Captain knew 'is dooty, an' he took the crackers out

An' he put some proper liquor in its place.

An' the Captain saw the shrapnel, which is six-an'-thirty clear.

('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)

"Will you draw the weight," sez 'e, "or will you draw the beer?"

An' we didn't keep 'im waitin' very long.

  ~For the Captain, etc.~


Then we trotted gentle, not to break the bloomin' glass,

Though the Arabites 'ad all their ranges marked;

But we dursn't 'ardly gallop, for the most was bottled Bass,

An' we'd dreamed of it since we was disembarked:

So we fired economic with the shells we 'ad in 'and,

('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)

But the beggars under cover 'ad the impidence to stand,

An' we couldn't keep 'em waitin' very long.

  ~And the Captain, etc.~


So we finished 'arf the liquor (an' the Captain took champagne),

An' the Arabites was shootin' all the while;

An' we left our wounded 'appy with the empties on the plain,

An' we used the bloomin' guns for pro-jec-tile!

We limbered up an' galloped -- there were nothin' else to do --

('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)

An' the Battery came a-boundin' like a boundin' kangaroo,

But they didn't watch us comin' very long.

  ~As the Captain, etc.~


We was goin' most extended -- we was drivin' very fine,

An' the Arabites were loosin' 'igh an' wide,

Till the Captain took the glassy with a rattlin' right incline,

An' we dropped upon their 'eads the other side.

Then we give 'em quarter -- such as 'adn't up and cut,

('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)

An' the Captain stood a limberful of fizzy -- somethin' Brutt,

But we didn't leave it fizzing very long.

  ~For the Captain, etc.~


We might ha' been court-martialled, but it all come out all right

When they signalled us to join the main command.

There was every round expended, there was every gunner tight,

An' the Captain waved a corkscrew in 'is 'and.

  ~But the Captain 'ad 'is jacket, etc.~

Poem 330: The Jester


There are three degrees of bliss

At the foot of Allah's Throne

And the highest place is his

Who saves a brother's soul

At peril of his own.

There is the Power made known!


There are three degrees of bliss

In Garden of Paradise,

And the second place is his

Who saves his brother's soul

By excellent advice.

For there the Glory lies!


There the are three degrees of bliss

And three abodes of the Blest,

And the lowest place is his

Who had saved a soul by jest

And a brother's soul in sport...

Poem 331: The Juggler's Song


When the drums begin to beat

Down the street,

When the poles are fetched and guyed,

When the tight-rope's stretched and tied,

When the dance-girls make salaam,

When the snake-bag wakes alarm,

When the pipes set up their drone,

When the sharp-edged knives are thrown

When the red-hot coals are shown,

To be swallowed by-and-by--

Arre, Brethren, here come I!


Stripped to loin-cloth in the sun,

Search me well and watch me close!

Tell me how my tricks are done--

Tell me how the mango grows!


Give a man who is not made

To his trade

Swords to fling and catch again,

Coins to ring and snatch again,

Men to harm and cure again,

Snakes to charm and lure again--

He'll be hurt by his own blade,

By his serpents disobeyed,

By his clumsiness bewrayed,

By the people laughed to scorn--

So 'tis not with juggler born!


Pinch of dust or withered flower,

Chance-flung nut or borrowed staff,

Serve his need and shore his power,

Bind the spell or loose the laugh!

Poem 332: The Junk and the Dhow


Once a pair of savages found a stranded tree.

 (One-piecee stick -pidgin -- two piecee man.

Straddle-um-paddle-um-push -um off to sea.

 That way Foleign Debbil-boat began.)

But before, and before, and ever so long before

 Any shape of sailing-craft was known,

The Junk and Dhow had a stern and a bow,

 And a mast and a sail of their own--ahoy! alone!

 As they crashed across the Oceans on their own!


Once there was a pirate-ship, being blown ashore--

 (Plitty soon pilum up, s'posee no can tack..

Seven-piecee stlong man pullum sta'boa'd oar.

But before, and before, an ever so long before

 Grand Commander Noah took the wheel,

The Junk and the Dhow, though they look like anyhow,

 Had rudders reaching deep below their keel--ahoy! akeel!

 As they laid the Eastern Seas beneath their keel!


Once there was galliot yawing in a tide.

 (Too much foolee side-slip. How can stop?

Man catchee tea box lid--lasha longaside.

 That way make her plenty glip and sail first-chop.)

But before and before, and ever so long before

 And such contrivances were used,

The whole Confucian sea-board had standardized the lee-board.

 And hauled it up or dropped it as they choosed--or chose--or

     chused!

 According to the weather, when they cruised!


Once there was a caravel in a beam-sea roll--

 (Ca'qo shiftee--alla dliftee-no can livee long.

 And of half the new inventions in our Ships!

 From Tarifa to Formosa in our Ships!

"Farewell, Romance!" the Cave-men said;

"With bone well carved he went away,

Flint arms the ignoble arrowhead,

And jasper tips the spear to-day.

Changed are the Gods of Hunt and Dance,

And he with these.  Farewell, Romance!"


"Farewell, Romance!" the Lake-folk sighed;

"We lift the weight of flatling years;

The caverns of the mountain-side

Hold him who scorns our hutted piers.

Lost hills whereby we dare not dwell,

Guard ye his rest.  Romance, farewell!"


"Farewell, Romance!" the Soldier spoke;

"By sleight of sword we may not win,

But scuffle 'mid uncleanly smoke

Of arquebus and culverin.

Honour is lost, and none may tell

Who paid good blows.  Romance, farewell!"


"Farewell, Romance!" the Traders cried;

Our keels ha' lain with every sea;

The dull-returning wind and tide

Heave up the wharf where we would be;

The known and noted breezes swell

Our trudging sail.  Romance, farewell!"


"Good-bye, Romance!" the Skipper said;

"He vanished with the coal we burn;

Our dial marks full steam ahead,

Our speed is timed to half a turn.

Sure as the ferried barge we ply

'Twixt port and port.  Romance, good-bye!"


"Romance!" the season-tickets mourn,

"~He~ never ran to catch his train,

But passed with coach and guard and horn --

And left the local -- late again!"

Confound Romance! . . .  And all unseen

Romance brought up the nine-fifteen.


His hand was on the lever laid,

His oil-can soothed the worrying cranks,

His whistle waked the snowbound grade,

His fog-horn cut the reeking Banks;

By dock and deep and mine and mill

The Boy-god reckless laboured still!


Robed, crowned and throned, he wove his spell,

Where heart-blood beat or hearth-smoke curled,

With unconsidered miracle,

Hedged in a backward-gazing world;

Then taught his chosen bard to say:

"Our King was with us -- yesterday!"

Poem 336: The King's Job


The Tudor Monarchy



Once on a time was a King anxious to understand

What was the wisest thing a man could do for his land.

Most of his population hurried to answer the question,

Each with a long oration, each with a new suggestion.

They interrupted his meals--he wasn't safe in his bed from 'em--

They hung round his neck and heels, and at last His Majesty fled

     from 'em.

He put on a leper's cloak (people leave lepers alone),

Out of the window he broke, and abdicated his throne.

All that rapturous day, while his Court and his ministers mourn

      him,

He danced on his own highway till his own Policeman warned

     him.

Gay and cheerful he ran (lepers don't cheer as a rule)

Till he found a philosopher-man teaching an infant-school.

The windows were open wide, the King sat down on the grass,

And heard the children inside reciting "Our King is an ass."

The King popped in his head: "Some people would call this

       treason,

But I think you are right," he said; "Will you kindly give me your

        reason?"    

Lepers in school are as rare as kings with a leper's dress on,

But the class didn't stop or stare; it calmly went on with the

        lesson:

"The wisest thing, we suppose, that a man can do for his land.

Is the work that lies under his nose, with the tools that lie under

       his hand."

The King whipped off his cloak, and stood in his crown before

       'em.

He said: "My dear little folk, Ex ore parvulorum--."

(Which is Latin for "Children know more than grown-ups would

       credit")

You have shown me the road to go, and I propose to tread it."

Back to his Kingdom he ran, and issued a Proclamation,

"Let every living man return to his occupation!"

Then he explained to the mob who cheered in his palace and round it,

"I've been to look for a job, and Heaven be praised I've found it!"

Poem 337: The King's Task


After the sack of the City when Rome was sunk to a name,

In the years that the lights were darkened,  or ever St. Wilfrid

     came,

Low on the borders of Britain (the ancient poets sing)

Between the Cliff and the Forest there ruled a Saxon King.

Stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord--

Not to be cowed by the cudgel, scarce to be schooled by the

     sword;

Quick to turn at their pleasure, cruel to cross in their mood,

And set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of Andred's Wood.

Laws they made in the Witan--the laws of flaying and fine--

Common, loppage and pannage, the theft and the track of kine--

Statutes of tun and of market for the fish and the malt and the

    meal--

The tax on the Bramber packhorse and the tax on the Hastings

      keel.

Over the graves of the Druids and under the wreck of Rome,

Rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come.

Behind the feet of the Legions and before the Norseman's ire

Rudely but greatly begat they the framing of State and Shire.

Rudely but deeply they laboured, and their labour stands till now,

If we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eight--ox

       plough...

There came a king from Hamlun, by Bosenham he came,

He filled Use with slaughter, and Lewes he gave to flame.

He smote while they sat in the Witan--sudden he smote and sore,

That his fleet was gathered at Selsea ere they mustered at Cymen's

       Ore.

Blithe went the Saxons to battle, by down and wood and mere,

But thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear.

Thrice was the beechmast gathered, and the Beltane fires burned

Thrice and, the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned.

They drove that king from Hamtun, by Bosenhame o'erthrown,

Our of Rugnor to Wilton they made his land their own.

Camps they builded at Gilling, at Basing and Alresford,

But wrath abode in the Saxons from cottar to overlord.

Wrath at the weary war-game, at the foe that snapped and ran,

Wolf-wise feigning and flying, and wolf-wise snatching his man.

Wrath for their spears unready, their levies new to the blade--

Shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscade.

At hearth and tavern and market, wherever the tale was told,

Shame and wrath had the Saxons because of their boasts of old.

And some would drink and deny it, and some would pray and

     atone;

But the most part, after their anger, avouched that the sin was

     their own.

Wherefore, girding together, up to the Witan they came,

And as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder

     their blame;

(For that was the wont of the Saxons, the ancient poets sing),

And first they spoke in the Witan and then they spoke to the

    King:

"Edward King of the Saxons, thou knowest from sire to son,

"One is the King and his People--in gain and ungain one.

"Count we the gain together. With doubtings and spread dismays

"We have broken a foolish people--but after many days.

"Count we the loss together. Warlocks hampered our arms.

"We were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms.

"We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep,

"But our angry eyes ever holden, and we struck as they strike

     in sleep--

"Men new shaken from slumber, sweating with eyes a-stare

"Little blows uncertain, dealt on the useless air.

"Also a vision betrayed us and a lying tale made bold,

"That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we

      did not hold:

That a shield should give us shelter--that a sword should give us

      power--

A shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an

    hour:

"That being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close--

"And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met

     our foes.

"This was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide,

"In our own camp we took them, and their names are Sloth and

      Pride.

"Our pride was before the battle, our sloth ere we lifted spear:

"But hid in the heart of the people, as the fever hides in the mere:

"Waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise

"As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed

       dries.

"But now we are purged of that fever--cleansed by the letting

       of blood,

"Something leaner of body--something keener of mood.

"And the men new--freed from the levies return to the fields again,

"Matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane;

"And they talk loud in the temples where the ancient war-

      gods are;

"They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war.

"They jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff.

"These things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears

     and laugh.

"The men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they

     range--

"And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change;

"And change may be good or evil--but we know not what it will

      bring;

"Therefore our King must teach us. That is thy task, O King!"

I've taken my fun where I've found it;

I've rogued an' I've ranged in my time;

I've 'ad my pickin' o' sweet'earts,

An' four o' the lot was prime.

One was an 'arf-caste widow,

One was a woman at Prome,

One was the wife of a ~jemadar-sais~,                        [Head-groom.]

An' one is a girl at 'ome.


    Now I aren't no 'and with the ladies,

      For, takin' 'em all along,

      They'll 'elp you a lot with the White!


I was a young un at 'Oogli,

Shy as a girl to begin;

Aggie de Castrer she made me,

An' Aggie was clever as sin;

Older than me, but my first un --

More like a mother she were --

Showed me the way to promotion an' pay,

An' I learned about women from 'er!


Then I was ordered to Burma,

Actin' in charge o' Bazar,

An' I got me a tiddy live 'eathen

Through buyin' supplies off 'er pa.

Funny an' yellow an' faithful --

Doll in a teacup she were,

But we lived on the square, like a true-married pair,

An' I learned about women from 'er!


Then we was shifted to Neemuch

(Or I might ha' been keepin' 'er now),

An' I took with a shiny she-devil,

The wife of a nigger at Mhow;

'Taught me the gipsy-folks' ~bolee~;                              [Slang.]

Kind o' volcano she were,

For she knifed me one night 'cause I wished she was white,

And I learned about women from 'er!


Then I come 'ome in the trooper,

'Long of a kid o' sixteen --

Girl from a convent at Meerut,

The straightest I ever 'ave seen.

Love at first sight was 'er trouble,

~She~ didn't know what it were;

An' I wouldn't do such, 'cause I liked 'er too much,

But -- I learned about women from 'er!


I've taken my fun where I've found it,

An' now I must pay for my fun,

For the more you 'ave known o' the others

The less will you settle to one;

An' the end of it's sittin' and thinkin',

An' dreamin' Hell-fires to see;

So be warned by my lot (which I know you will not),

An' learn about women from me!

Poem 340: The Lament OF The Border Cattle Thief


O woe is me for the merry life

I led beyond the Bar,

And a treble woe for my winsome wife

That weeps at Shalimar.


They have taken away my long jezail,

My shield and sabre fine,

And heaved me into the Central jail

For lifting of the kine.


The steer may low within the byre,

The Jat may tend his grain,

But there'll be neither loot nor fire

Till I come back again.


And God have mercy on the Jat

When once my fetters fall,

And Heaven defend the farmer's hut

When I am loosed from thrall.


It's woe to bend the stubborn back

Above the grinching quern,

It's woe to hear the leg-bar clack

And jingle when I turn!


But for the sorrow and the shame,

The brand on me and mine,

I'll pay you back in leaping flame

And loss of the butchered kine.


For every cow I spared before

In charity set free,

If I may reach my hold once more

I'll reive an honest three.


For every time I raised the low

That scared the dusty plain,

By sword and cord, by torch and tow

I'll light the land with twain!


Ride hard, ride hard to Abazai,

Young ~Sahib~ with the yellow hair --

Lie close, lie close as khuttucks lie,

Fat herds below Bonair!


The one I'll shoot at twilight-tide,

At dawn I'll drive the other;

The black shall mourn for hoof and hide,

The white man for his brother.


'Tis war, red war, I'll give you then,

War till my sinews fail;

For the wrong you have done to a chief of men,

And a thief of the Zukka Kheyl.


And if I fall to your hand afresh

I give you leave for the sin,

That you cram my throat with the foul pig's flesh,

And swing me in the skin!

Saying:  "What about that River-piece for layin' in to hay?"


And the aged Hobden answered:  "I remember as a lad

My father told your father that she wanted dreenin' bad.

An' the more that you neeglect her the less you'll get her clean.

Have it jest as you've a mind to, but, if I was you, I'd dreen."


So they drained it long and crossways in the lavish Roman style--

Still we find among the river-drift their flakes of ancient tile,

And  in  drouthy  middle  August,  when  the  bones  of  meadows show,

We can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago.


Then Julius Fabricius died as even Prefects do,

And after certain centuries, Imperial Rome died too.

Then did robbers enter Britain from across the Northern main

And our Lower River-field was won by Ogier the Dane.


Well could Ogier work his war-boat --well could Ogier wield his brand--

Much he knew of foaming waters--not so much of farming land.

So he called to him a Hobden of the old unaltered blood,

Saying: "What about that River-piece; she doesn't look no good?"


And that aged Hobden answered "'Tain't for me not interfere.

But I've known that bit o' meadow now for five and fifty year.

Have it jest as you've a mind to, but I've proved it time on ' time,

If you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime!"


Ogier sent his wains to Lewes, twenty hours' solemn walk,

And drew back great abundance of the cool, grey, healing chalk.

And old Hobden spread it broadcast, never heeding what was in't.--

Which is why in cleaning ditches, now and then we find a flint.


Ogier died. His sons grew English -- Anglo-Saxon was their name--

Till out of blossomed Normandy another pirate came;

For Duke William conquered England and divided with his men,

And our Lower River-field he gave to William of Warenne.


But the Brook (you know her habit) rose one rainy autumn night  

And tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right.

So, said William to his Bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds:

"Hob, what about that River-bit--the Brook's got up no bounds? "


And that aged Hobden answered: "'Tain't my business to advise,

But  ye might ha' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies.

Where ye can't hold back the water you must try and save the sile.

Hev it jest as you've a mind to, but, if I was you, I'd spile!"


They spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees,

And planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees.

And when the spates of Autumn whirl the gravel-beds away

You can see their faithful fragments, iron-hard in iron clay.


.       .          .         .          .      .         .          .            .             .


Georgii Quinti Anno Sexto, I, who own the River-field,

 Am fortified with title-deeds, attested, signed and sealed,

 Guaranteeing me, my assigns, my executors and heirs

 All sorts of powers and profits which-are neither mine nor theirs,


 I have rights of chase and warren, as my dignity requires.

 I can fish-but Hobden tickles--I can shoot--but Hobden wires.

 I repair, but he reopens, certain gaps which, men allege,

 Have been used by every Hobden since a Hobden swapped a hedge.


Shall I dog his morning progress o'er the track-betraying dew?

Demand his dinner-basket into which my pheasant flew?

Confiscate his evening faggot under which my conies ran,

And summons him to judgment? I would sooner summons Pan.


His dead are in the churchyard--thirty generations laid.

Their names were old in history when Domesday Book was made;

And the passion and the piety and prowess of his line

Have seeded, rooted, fruited in some land the Law calls mine.


Not for any beast that burrows, not for any bird that flies,

Would I lose his large sound council, miss his keen amending eyes.

He is bailiff, woodman, wheelwright, field-surveyor, engineer,

And if flagrantly a poacher--'tain't for me to interfere.


"Hob, what about that River-bit?" I turn to him again,

With Fabricius and Ogier and William of Warenne.

"Hev it jest as you've a mind to, but"-and here he takes command.

For whoever pays the taxes old Mus' Hobden owns the land.

Poem 342: The Landau


Praed



There  was a landau deep and wide,

 Cushioned for Sleep's own self to sit on--

The glory of the country-side

 From Tanner's End to Marlow Ditton.

John of the broad and brandied cheek

  (Well I recall its eau-de-vie hues!)

Drove staid Sir Ralph five days a week

 At speeds which we considered Jehu's...


But now' poor John sleeps very sound,

 And neither hears nor smells the fuss

Of the young Squire's nine-hundred-pound--

Er-Mors communis omnibus.

And I who in my daily stroll

 Observe the reckless chauffeur crowd her,

Laudator temporis, extol

 The times before the Act allowed her.

Poem 343: The Last Chantey


Thus said The Lord in the Vault above the Cherubim

Calling to the Angels and the Souls in their degree:

 "Lo!  Earth has passed away

 On the smoke of Judgment Day.

That Our word may be established shall We gather up the sea?"


Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners:

"Plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee!

 But the war is done between us,

 In the deep the Lord hath seen us --

Our bones we'll leave the barracout', and God may sink the sea!"


Then said the soul of Judas that betray]ed Him:

"Lord, hast Thou forgotten Thy covenant with me?

 How once a year I go

 To cool me on the floe?

And Ye take my day of mercy if Ye take away the sea!"


Then said the soul of the Angel of the Off-shore Wind:

(He that bits the thunder when the bull-mouthed breakers flee):

 "I have watch and ward to keep

 O'er Thy wonders on the deep,

And Ye take mine honour from me if Ye take away the sea!"


Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners:

"Nay, but we were angry, and a hasty folk are we!

 If we worked the ship together

 Till she foundered in foul weather,

Are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea?"


Then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard:

"Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we;

 But Thy arm was strong to save,

 And it touched us on the wave,

And we drowsed the long tides idle till Thy Trumpets tore the sea."


Then cried the soul of the stout Apostle Paul to God:

"Once we frapped a ship, and she laboured woundily.

 There were fourteen score of these,

 And they blessed Thee on their knees,

When they learned Thy Grace and Glory under Malta by the sea!"


Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,

Plucking at their harps, and they plucked unhandily:

 "Our thumbs are rough and tarred,

 And the tune is something hard --

May we lift a Deep-sea Chantey such as seamen use at sea?"


Then said the souls of the gentlemen-adventurers --

Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity:

 "Ho, we revel in our chains

 O'er the sorrow that was Spain's;

Heave or sink it, leave or drink it, we were masters of the sea!"


Up spake the soul of a gray Gothavn 'speckshioner --

(He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee):

 "Oh, the ice-blink white and near,

 And the bowhead breaching clear!

Will Ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea?"


Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,

Crying:  "Under Heaven, here is neither lead nor lee!

 Must we sing for evermore

 On the windless, glassy floor?

Take back your golden fiddles and we'll beat to open sea!"


Then stooped the Lord, and He called the good sea up to Him,

And 'stablished his borders unto all eternity,

 That such as have no pleasure

 For to praise the Lord by measure,

They may enter into galleons and serve Him on the sea.


    Sun, wind, and cloud shall fail not from the face of it,

     Stinging, ringing spindrift, nor the fulmar flying free;

      And the ships shall go abroad

      To the Glory of the Lord

     Who heard the silly sailor-folk and gave them back their sea!

Poem 344: The Last Department


Twelve hundred million men are spread

About this Earth, and I and You

   Wonder, when You and I are dead,

   "What will those luckless millions do?"


None whole or clean, " we cry, "or free from stain

Of favour." Wait awhile, till we attain

 The Last Department where nor fraud nor fools,

Nor grade nor greed, shall trouble us again.


Fear, Favour, or Affection -- what are these

To the grim Head who claims our services?

 I never knew a wife or interest yet

Delay that pukka step, miscalled "decease";


When leave, long overdue, none can deny;

When idleness of all Eternity

 Becomes our furlough, and the marigold

Our thriftless, bullion-minting Treasury


Transferred to the Eternal Settlement,

Each in his strait, wood-scantled office pent,

 No longer Brown reverses Smith's appeals,

Or Jones records his Minute of Dissent.


And One, long since a pillar of the Court,

As mud between the beams thereof is wrought;

 And One who wrote on phosphates for the crops

Is subject-matter of his own Report.


These be the glorious ends whereto we pass --

Let Him who Is, go call on Him who Was;

 And He shall see the mallie steals the slab

For currie-grinder, and for goats the grass.


A breath of wind, a Border bullet's flight,

A draught of water, or a horse's firght --

 The droning of the fat Sheristadar

Ceases, the punkah stops, and falls the night


For you or Me. Do those who live decline

The step that offers, or their work resign?

 Trust me, To-day's Most Indispensables,

Five hundred men can take your place or mine.

Poem 345: The Last Lap


How do we know, by the bank-high river,

 Where the mired and sulky oxen wait,

And it looks as though we might wait for ever,

 How do we know that the floods abate?

There is no change in the current's brawling--

 Louder and harsher the freshet scolds;

Yet we can feel she is falling, falling

 And the more she threatens the less she holds,

Down to the drift, with no word spoken,

 The wheel-chained wagons slither and slue....

Achtung! The back of the worst is broken!

 And--lash your leaders!--we're through--we're through!


How do we know, when the port-fog holds us

 Moored and helpless, a mile from the pier,

And the week-long summer smother enfolds us--

 How do we know it is going to clear?

There is no break in the blindfold weather,

 But, one and another, about the bay,

The unseen capstans clink together,

 Getting ready to up and away.

A pennon whimpers--the breeze has found us--

 A headsail jumps through the thinning haze.

The whole hull follows, till--broad around us--

 The clean-swept ocean says: "Go your ways!"


How do we know, when the long fight rages,

 On the old, stale front that we cannot shake,

And it looks as though we were locked for ages,

 How do we know they are going to break?

There is no lull in the level firing,

 Nothing has shifted except the sun.

Yet we can feel they are tiring, tiring--

 Yet we can tell they are ripe to run.

Something wavers, and, while we wonder,

 Their centre-trenches are emptying out,

And, before their useless flanks go under,

 Our guns have pounded retreat to rout!

Poem 346: The Last Ode


As watchers couched beneath a Bantine oak,

 Hearing the dawn-wind stir,

Know that the present strength of night is broke

 Though no dawn threaten her

Till dawn's appointed hour--so Virgil died,

 Aware of change at hand, and prophesied


Change upon all the Eternal Gods had made

 And on the Gods alike--

Fated as dawn but, as the dawn, delayed

 Till the just hour should strike--


A Star new-risen above the living and dead;

 And the lost shades that were our loves restored

As lovers, and for ever. So he said;

 Having received the word...


Maecenas waits me on the Esquiline:

 Thither to-night go I....

And shall this dawn restore us, Virgil mine

 To dawn? Beneath what sky?

Poem 347: The Last of the Light Brigade


There were thirty million English who talked of England's might,

There were twenty broken troopers who lacked a bed for the night.

They had neither food nor money, they had neither service nor trade;

They were only shiftless soldiers, the last of the Light Brigade.


They felt that life was fleeting; they knew not that art was long,

That though they were dying of famine, they lived in deathless song.

They asked for a little money to keep the wolf from the door;

And the thirty million English sent twenty pounds and four!


They laid their heads together that were scarred and lined and grey;

Keen were the Russian sabres, but want was keener than they;

And an old Troop-Sergeant muttered, "Let us go to the man who writes

The things on Balaclava the kiddies at school recites."


They went without bands or colours, a regiment ten-file strong,

To look for the Master-singer who had crowned them all in his song;

And, waiting his servant's order, by the garden gate they stayed,

A desolate little cluster, the last of the Light Brigade.


They strove to stand to attention, to straighten the toil-bowed back;

They drilled on an empty stomach, the loose-knit files fell slack;

With stooping of weary shoulders, in garments tattered and frayed,

They shambled into his presence, the last of the Light Brigade.


The old Troop-Sergeant was spokesman, and "Beggin' your pardon," he said,

"You wrote o' the Light Brigade, sir. Here's all that isn't dead.

An' it's all come true what you wrote, sir, regardin' the mouth of hell;

For we're all of us nigh to the workhouse, an, we thought we'd call an' tell.


"No, thank you, we don't want food, sir; but couldn't you take an' write

A sort of 'to be continued' and 'see next page' o' the fight?

We think that someone has blundered, an' couldn't you tell 'em how?

You wrote we were heroes once, sir. Please, write we are starving now."


The poor little army departed, limping and lean and forlorn.

And the heart of the Master-singer grew hot with "the scorn of scorn."

And he wrote for them wonderful verses that swept the land like flame,

Till the fatted souls of the English were scourged with the thing called Shame.


O thirty million English that babble of England's might,

Behold there are twenty heroes who lack their food to-night;

Our children's children are lisping to "honour the charge they made-"

And we leave to the streets and the workhouse the charge of the Light Brigade!

Poem 348: The Last Rhyme Of True Thomas


The King has called for priest and cup,

The King has taken spur and blade

To dub True Thomas a belted knight,

And all for the sake o' the songs he made.


They have sought him high, they have sought him low,

They have sought him over down and lea;

They have found him by the milk-white thorn

That guards the gates o' Faerie.


    'Twas bent beneath and blue above,

      Their eyes were held that they might not see

    The kine that grazed beneath the knowes,

      Oh, they were the Queens o' Faerie!


"Now cease your song," the King he said,

"Oh, cease your song and get you dight

To vow your vow and watch your arms,

For I will dub you a belted knight.


"For I will give you a horse o' pride,

Wi' blazon and spur and page and squire;

Wi' keep and tail and seizin and law,

And land to hold at your desire."


True Thomas smiled above his harp,

And turned his face to the naked sky,

Where, blown before the wastrel wind,

The thistle-down she floated by.


"I ha' vowed my vow in another place,

And bitter oath it was on me,

I ha' watched my arms the lee-long night,

Where five-score fighting men would flee.


"My lance is tipped o' the hammered flame,

My shield is beat o' the moonlight cold;

And I won my spurs in the Middle World,

A thousand fathom beneath the mould.


"And what should I make wi' a horse o' pride,

And what should I make wi' a sword so brown,

But spill the rings o' the Gentle Folk

And flyte my kin in the Fairy Town?


"And what should I make wi' blazon and belt,

Wi' keep and tail and seizin and fee,

And what should I do wi' page and squire

That am a king in my own countrie?


"For I send east and I send west,

And I send far as my will may flee,

By dawn and dusk and the drinking rain,

And syne my Sendings return to me.


"They come wi' news of the groanin' earth,

They come wi' news o' the roarin' sea,

Wi' word of Spirit and Ghost and Flesh,

And man, that's mazed among the three."


The King he bit his nether lip,

And smote his hand upon his knee:

"By the faith o' my soul, True Thomas," he said,

"Ye waste no wit in courtesie!


"As I desire, unto my pride,

Can I make Earls by three and three,

To run before and ride behind

And serve the sons o' my body."


"And what care I for your row-foot earls,

Or all the sons o' your body?

Before they win to the Pride o' Name,

I trow they all ask leave o' me.


"For I make Honour wi' muckle mouth,

As I make Shame wi' mincin' feet,

To sing wi' the priests at the market-cross,

Or run wi' the dogs in the naked street.


"And some they give me the good red gold,

And some they give me the white money,

And some they give me a clout o' meal,

For they be people o' low degree.


"And the song I sing for the counted gold

The same I sing for the white money,

But best I sing for the clout o' meal

That simple people given me."


The King cast down a silver groat,

A silver groat o' Scots money,

"If I come wi' a poor man's dole," he said,

"True Thomas, will ye harp to me?"


"Whenas I harp to the children small,

They press me close on either hand.

And who are you," True Thomas said,

"That you should ride while they must stand?


"Light down, light down from your horse o' pride,

I trow ye talk too loud and hie,

And I will make you a triple word,

And syne, if ye dare, ye shall 'noble me."


He has lighted down from his horse o' pride,

And set his back against the stone.

"Now guard you well," True Thomas said,

"Ere I rax your heart from your breast-bone!"


True Thomas played upon his harp,

The fairy harp that couldna lee,

And the first least word the proud King heard,

It harpit the salt tear out o' his ee.


"Oh, I see the love that I lost long syne,

I touch the hope that I may not see,

And all that I did o' hidden shame,

Like little snakes they hiss at me.


"The sun is lost at noon -- at noon!

The dread o' doom has grippit me.

True Thomas, hide me under your cloak,

God wot, I'm little fit to dee!"


    'Twas bent beneath and blue above --

      'Twas open field and running flood --

    Where, hot on heath and dike and wall,

      The high sun warmed the adder's brood.


"Lie down, lie down," True Thomas said.

"The God shall judge when all is done.

But I will bring you a better word

And lift the cloud that I laid on."


True Thomas played upon his harp,

That birled and brattled to his hand,

And the next least word True Thomas made,

It garred the King take horse and brand.


"Oh, I hear the tread o' the fighting men,

I see the sun on splent and spear.

I mark the arrow outen the fern

That flies so low and sings so clear!


"Advance my standards to that war,

And bid my good knights prick and ride;

The gled shall watch as fierce a fight

As e'er was fought on the Border side!"


    'Twas bent beneath and blue above,

      'Twas nodding grass and naked sky,

    Where, ringing up the wastrel wind,

      The eyas stooped upon the pie.


True Thomas sighed above his harp,

And turned the song on the midmost string;

And the last least word True Thomas made,

He harpit his dead youth back to the King.


"Now I am prince, and I do well

To love my love withouten fear;

To walk wi' man in fellowship,

And breathe my horse behind the deer.


"My hounds they bay unto the death,

The buck has couched beyond the burn,

My love she waits at her window

To wash my hands when I return.


"For that I live am I content

(Oh! I have seen my true love's eyes)

To stand wi' Adam in Eden-glade,

And run in the woods o' Paradise!"


    'Twas naked sky and nodding grass,

      'Twas running flood and wastrel wind,

    Where, checked against the open pass,

      The red deer belled to call the hind.


True Thomas laid his harp away,

And louted low at the saddle-side;

He has taken stirrup and hauden rein,

And set the King on his horse o' pride.


"Sleep ye or wake," True Thomas said,

"That sit so still, that muse so long;

Sleep ye or wake? -- till the latter sleep

I trow ye'll not forget my song.


"I ha' harpit a shadow out o' the sun

To stand before your face and cry;

I ha' armed the earth beneath your heel,

And over your head I ha' dusked the sky.


"I ha' harpit ye up to the throne o' God,

I ha' harpit your midmost soul in three;

I ha' harpit ye down to the Hinges o' Hell,

And -- ye -- would -- make -- a Knight o' me!"

Poem 349: The Last Suttee


Not many years ago a King died in one of the Rajpoot States. His wives, disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee, would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred. But one of them, disguised as the King's favourite dancing-girl, passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre.  There, her courage failing, she prayed her cousin, a baron of the court, to kill her.  This he did, not knowing who she was.


Udai Chand lay sick to death

   In his hold by Gungra hill.

All night we heard the death-gongs ring

For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King,

All night beat up from the women's wing

   A cry that we could not still.


All night the barons came and went,

   The lords of the outer guard:

All night the cressets glimmered pale

On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail,

Mewar headstall and Marwar mail,

   That clinked in the palace yard.


In the Golden room on the palace roof

   All night he fought for air:

And there was sobbing behind the screen,

Rustle and whisper of women unseen,

And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen

   On the death she might not share.


He passed at dawn -- the death-fire leaped

   From ridge to river-head,

From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars:

And wail upon wail went up to the stars

Behind the grim zenana-bars,

   When they knew that the King was dead.


The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth

   And robe him for the pyre.

The Boondi Queen beneath us cried:

"See, now, that we die as our mothers died

In the bridal-bed by our master's side!

   Out, women! -- to the fire!"


We drove the great gates home apace:

   White hands were on the sill:

But ere the rush of the unseen feet

Had reached the turn to the open street,

The bars shot down, the guard-drum beat --

   We held the dovecot still.


A face looked down in the gathering day,

   And laughing spoke from the wall:

"Oh]/e, they mourn here:  let me by --

Azizun, the  Lucknow nautch-girl, I!

When the house is rotten, the rats must fly,

   And I seek another thrall.


"For I ruled the King as ne'er did Queen, --

   To-night the Queens rule me!

Guard them safely, but let me go,

Or ever they pay the debt they owe

In scourge and torture!"  She leaped below,

   And the grim guard watched her flee.


They knew that the King had spent his soul

   On a North-bred dancing-girl:

That he prayed to a flat-nosed Lucknow god,

And kissed the ground where her feet had trod,

And doomed to death at her drunken nod,

   And swore by her lightest curl.


We bore the King to his fathers' place,

   Where the tombs of the Sun-born stand:

Where the gray apes swing, and the peacocks preen

On fretted pillar and jewelled screen,

And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen

   On the drift of the desert sand.


The herald read his titles forth,

   We set the logs aglow:

"Friend of the English, free from fear,

Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer,

Lord of the Desert of Bikaneer,

   King of the Jungle, -- go!"


All night the red flame stabbed the sky

   With wavering wind-tossed spears:

And out of a shattered temple crept

A woman who veiled her head and wept,

And called on the King -- but the great King slept,

   And turned not for her tears.


Small thought had he to mark the strife --

   Cold fear with hot desire --

When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame,

And thrice she beat her breast for shame,

And thrice like a wounded dove she came

   And moaned about the fire.


One watched, a bow-shot from the blaze,

   The silent streets between,

Who had stood by the King in sport and fray,

To blade in ambush or boar at bay,

And he was a baron old and gray,

   And kin to the Boondi Queen.


He said:  "O shameless, put aside

   The veil upon thy brow!

Who held the King and all his land

To the wanton will of a harlot's hand!

Will the white ash rise from the blistered brand?

   Stoop down, and call him now!"


Then she:  "By the faith of my tarnished soul,

   All things I did not well,

I had hoped to clear ere the fire died,

And lay me down by my master's side

To rule in Heaven his only bride,

   While the others howl in Hell.


"But I have felt the fire's breath,

   And hard it is to die!

Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord

To sully the steel of a Thakur's sword

With base-born blood of a trade abhorred," --

   And the Thakur answered, "Ay."


He drew and struck:  the straight blade drank

   The life beneath the breast.

"I had looked for the Queen to face the flame,

But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame --

Sister of mine, pass, free from shame,

   Pass with thy King to rest!"


The black log crashed above the white:

   The little flames and lean,

Red as slaughter and blue as steel,

That whistled and fluttered from head to heel,

Leaped up anew, for they found their meal

   On the heart of -- the Boondi Queen!

Poem 350: The Law of the Jungle


Now this is the Law of the Jungle -- as old and as true as the sky; And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die. As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back --

For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.



Wash daily from nose-tip to tail-tip; drink deeply, but never too deep;

And remember the night is for hunting, and forget not the day is for sleep.

The Jackal may follow the Tiger, but, Cub, when thy whiskers are grown,

Remember the Wolf is a Hunter -- go forth and get food of thine own.

Keep peace withe Lords of the Jungle -- the Tiger, the Panther, and Bear.

And trouble not Hathi the Silent, and mock not the Boar in his lair.

When Pack meets with Pack in the Jungle, and neither will go from the trail,

Lie down till the leaders have spoken -- it may be fair words shall prevail.

When ye fight with a Wolf of the Pack, ye must fight him alone and afar,

Lest others take part in the quarrel, and the Pack be diminished by war.

The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, and where he has made him his home,

Not even the Head Wolf may enter, not even the Council may come.

The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, but where he has digged it too plain,

The Council shall send him a message, and so he shall change it again.

If ye kill before midnight, be silent, and wake not the woods with your bay,

Lest ye frighten the deer from the crop, and your brothers go empty away.

Ye may kill for yourselves, and your mates, and your cubs as they need, and ye can;

But kill not for pleasure of killing, and seven times never kill Man!

If ye plunder his Kill from a weaker, devour not all in thy pride;

Pack-Right is the right of the meanest; so leave him the head and the hide.

The Kill of the Pack is the meat of the Pack. Ye must eat where it lies;

And no one may carry away of that meat to his lair, or he dies.

The Kill of the Wolf is the meat of the Wolf. He may do what he will;

But, till he has given permission, the Pack may not eat of that Kill.

Cub-Right is the right of the Yearling. From all of his Pack he may claim

Full-gorge when the killer has eaten; and none may refuse him the same.

Lair-Right is the right of the Mother. From all of her year she may claim

One haunch of each kill for her litter, and none may deny her the same.

Cave-Right is the right of the Father -- to hunt by himself for his own:

He is freed of all calls to the Pack; he is judged by the Council alone.

Because of his age and his cunning, because of his gripe and his paw,

In all that the Law leaveth open, the word of your Head Wolf is Law.

Now these are the Laws of the Jungle, and many and mighty are they;

But the head and the hoof of the Law and the haunch and the hump is -- Obey!

Poem 351: The Legend of Mirth


The Four Archangels, so the legends tell,

Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, Azrael,

Being first of those to whom the Power was shown

Stood first of all the Host before The Throne,

And, when the Charges were allotted, burst

Tumultuous-winged from out the assembly first.

Zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed

Their own high judgment on their lightest deed.

Zeal was their spur that, when relief was given,

Urged them unwearied to new toils in Heaven;    

For Honour's sake perfecting every task

Beyond what e 'en Perfection's self could ask.   .   .

And Allah, Who created Zeal and Pride,

Knows how the twain are perilous-near allied.



It chanced on one of Heaven's long-lighted days,

The Four and all the Host being gone their ways

Each to his Charge, the shining Courts were void

Save for one Seraph whom no charge employed,

With folden wings and slumber-threatened brow,

To whom The Word:  "Beloved, what dost thou?"

"By the Permission," came the answer soft,

Little I do nor do that little oft.

As is The Will in Heaven so on Earth

Where by The Will I strive to make men mirth"

He ceased and sped, hearing The Word once more:

" Beloved, go thy way and greet the Four."


Systems and Universes overpast,

The Seraph came upon the Four, at last,

Guiding and guarding with devoted mind

The tedious generations of mankind

Who lent at most unwilling ear and eye

When they could not escape the ministry.   .   .   .

Yet, patient, faithful, firm, persistent, just

Toward all that gross, indifferent, facile dust,

The Archangels laboured to discharge their trust

By precept and example, prayer and law,

Advice, reproof, and rule, but, labouring, saw

Each in his fellows' countenance confessed,

The Doubt that sickens: "Have I done my best?"


Even as they sighed and turned to toil anew,

The Seraph hailed them with observance due;

And, after some fit talk of higher things,

Touched tentative on mundane happenings.

This they permitting, he, emboldened thus,

Prolused of humankind promiscuous,

And, since the large contention less avails

Than instances observed, he told them tales--

Tales of the shop, the bed, the court, the street,

Intimate, elemental, indiscreet:

Occasions where Confusion smiting swift

Piles jest on jest as snow-slides pile the drift

Whence, one by one, beneath derisive skies,

The victims' bare, bewildered heads arise--

Tales of the passing of the spirit, graced

With humour blinding as the doom it faced--

Stark tales of ribaldy that broke aside

To tears, by laughter swallowed ere they dried-

Tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue,

But Only (Allah be exalted!) true,

And only, as the Seraph showed that night,

Delighting to the limits of delight.



These he rehearsed with artful pause and halt,

And such pretence of memory at fault,

That soon the Four--so well the bait was thrown--

Came to his aid with memories of their own--

Matters dismissed long since as small or vain,

Whereof the high significance had lain

Hid, till the ungirt glosses made it plain.

Then, as enlightenment came broad and fast,

Each marvelled at his own oblivious past

Until--the Gates of Laughter opened wide--

The Four, with that bland Seraph at their side,

While they recalled, compared, and amplified,

In utter mirth forgot both Zeal and Pride!



High over Heaven the lamps of midnight  burned

Ere, weak with merriment, the Four returned,

Not in that order they were wont to keep--

Pinion to pinion answering, sweep for sweep,

In awful diapason heard afar--

But shoutingly adrift 'twixt star and star;

Reeling a planet's orbit left or right

As laughter took them in the abysmal Night;

Or, by the point of some remembered jest,

Winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed,

Where the blank worlds that gather to the birth

Leaped in the Womb of Darkness at their mirth,

And e'en Gehenna's bondsmen understood.

They were not damned from human brotherhood   .   .   .


Not first nor last of Heaven's high Host, the Four

That night took place beneath The Throne once more.

0 lovelier than their morning majesty,

The understanding light behind the eye!

0 more compelling than their old command,

The new-learned friendly gesture of the hand!

0 sweeter than their zealous fellowship,

The wise half-smile that passed from lip to lip!

0 well and roundly, when Command was given,

They told their tale against themselves to Heaven,

And in the silence, waiting on The Word,

Received the Peace and Pardon of The Lord!

Poem 352: The Legend of the Foreign Office


Rajah of Kolazai,

Drinketh the "simpkin" and brandy peg,

Maketh the money to fly,

Vexeth a Government, tender and kind,

Also -- but this is a detail -- blind.



Rustum Beg of Kolazai -- slightly backward Native State --

Lusted for a C.S.I. -- so began to sanitate.

Built a Gaol and Hospital -- nearly built a City drain --

Till his faithful subjects all thought their ruler was insane.


Strange departures made he then -- yea, Departments stranger still:

Half a dozen Englishmen helped the Rajah with a will,

Talked of noble aims and high, hinted of a future fine

For the State of Kolazai, on a strictly Western line.


Fajah Rustum held his peace; lowered octroi dues a half;

Organised a State Police; purified the Civil Staff;

Settled cess and tax aftresh in a very liberal way;

Cut temptations of the flesh -- also cut the Bukhshi's pay;


Roused his Secretariat to a fine Mahratta fury,

By an Order hinting at supervision of dasturi;

Turned the State of Kolazai very nearly upside-down;

When the end of May was night waited his achievement's crown.


Then the Birthday Honours came. Sad to state and sad to see,

Stood against the Rajah's name nothing more than C.I.E.!. . .

Things were lively for a week in the State of Kolazai,

Even now the people speak of that time regretfully.


How he disendowed the Gaol -- stopped at once the City drain;

Turned to beauty fair and frail -- got his senses back again;

Doubled taxes, cesses, all; cleared away each new-built thana;

Turned the two-lakh Hospital into a superb Zenana;


Heaped upon the Bukshi Sahib wealth and honours manifold;

Glad himself in Eastern garb -- squeezed his people as of old.

Happy, happy Kolazai! Never more will Rustum Beg

Play to catch his Viceroy's eye. He prefers the "simpkin" peg.

Poem 353: The Legends Of Evil


This is the sorrowful story

Told when the twilight fails

And the monkeys walk together

Holding their neighbours' tails: --


"Our fathers lived in the forest,

Foolish people were they,

They went down to the cornland

To teach the farmers to play.


"Our fathers frisked in the millet,

Our fathers skipped in the wheat,

Our fathers hung from the branches,

Our fathers danced in the street.


"Then came the terrible farmers,

Nothing of play they knew,

Only. . .they caught our fathers

And set them to labour too!


"Set them to work in the cornland

With ploughs and sickles and flails,

Put them in mud-walled prisons

And -- cut off their beautiful tails!


"Now, we can watch our fathers,

Sullen and bowed and old,

Stooping over the millet,

Sharing the silly mould,


"Driving a foolish furrow,

Mending a muddy yoke,

Sleeping in mud-walled prisons,

Steeping their food in smoke.


"We may not speak to our fathers,

For if the farmers knew

They would come up to the forest

And set us to labour too."


This is the horrible story

Told as the twilight fails

And the monkeys walk together

Holding their kinsmen's tails.

'Twas when the rain fell steady an' the Ark was pitched an' ready,

That Noah got his orders for to take the bastes below;

He dragged them all together by the horn an' hide an' feather,

An' all excipt the Donkey was agreeable to go.


Thin Noah spoke him fairly, thin talked to him sevarely,

An' thin he cursed him squarely to the glory av the Lord: --

"Divil take the ass that bred you, and the greater ass that fed you --

Divil go wid you, ye spalpeen!" an' the Donkey went aboard.


But the wind was always failin', an' 'twas most onaisy sailin',

An' the ladies in the cabin couldn't stand the stable air;

An' the bastes betwuxt the hatches, they tuk an' died in batches,

Till Noah said: -- "There's wan av us that hasn't paid his fare!"


For he heard a flusteration 'mid the bastes av all creation --

The trumpetin' av elephints an' bellowin' av whales;

An' he saw forninst the windy whin he wint to stop the shindy

The Divil wid a stable-fork bedivillin' their tails.


The Divil cursed outrageous, but Noah said umbrageous: --

"To what am I indebted for this tenant-right invasion?"

An' the Divil gave for answer: -- "Evict me if you can, sir,

For I came in wid the Donkey -- on Your Honour's invitation."

Poem 354: The Lesson


Let us admit it fairly, as a business people should,

We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good.


Not on a single issue, or in one direction or twain,

But conclusively,  comprehensively,  and  several times and

     again,


Were all our most holy illusions knocked higher than Gilde-

     roy's kite.

We have had a jolly good lesson, and it serves us jolly well

    right !


This was not bestowed us under the trees, nor yet in the shade

    of a tent,

But swingingly, over eleven degrees of a bare brown conti-

    nent.

From  Lamberts  to Delagoa  Bay, and  from Pietersburg  to

    Sutherland,

Fell the phenomenal lesson we learned-with a fullness ac-

    corded no other land.


It was our fault, and our very great fault, and not the judg-

    ment of Heaven.

We made an Army in our own image, on an island nine by

    seven,

Which faithfully mirrored its makers' ideals, equipment, and

    mental attitude--

And so we got our lesson: and we ought to accept it with

    gratitude.


We have spent two hundred million pounds to prove the fact

    once more,

That horses are quicker than men afoot, since two and two

    make four;

And horses have four legs, and men have two legs, and two

    into four goes twice,

And nothing over except our lesson--and very cheap at the

    price.


For remember (this our children shall know: we are too near

    for that knowledge)

Not our mere astonied camps, but Council and Creed and

    College--

All the obese, unchallenged old things that stifle and overlie

    us--

Have felt the effects of the lesson we got-an advantage no

    money could by us!


Then let us develop  this marvellous  asset which we alone

    command,

And which, it may subsequently transpire, will be worth as

    much as the Rand.

Let us approach this pivotal fact in a humble yet hopeful

    mood--

We have had no end of a lesson, it will do us no end of good!


It was our fault, and our very great fault--and now we must

    turn it to use.

We have forty million reasons for failure,  but not a single

    excuse.

So the more we work and the less we talk the better results

    we shall get--

We have had an Imperial lesson; it may make us an Empire

    yet!

Poem 355: The Light That Failed


So we settled it all when the storm was done

As comfy as comfy could be;

And I was to wait in the barn, my dears,

Because I was only three.

And Teddy would run to the rainbow's foot

Because he was five and a man--

And that's how it all began, my dears,

And that's how it all began!


Then we brought the lances down--then the trumpets blew--

When we went to Kandahar, ridin' two an' two.

      Ridin'--ridin'--ridin' two an' two!

             Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-a!

             All the way to Kandahar,

      Ridin' two an' two.


The wolf-cub at even lay hid in the corn,

When the smoke of the cooking hung grey.

He knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn,

And he looked to his strength for his prey.

But the moon swept the smoke-wreaths away;

And he turned from his meal in the villager's close,

And he bayed to the moon as she rose.


"I have a thousand men," said he,

  "To wait upon my will;

And towers nine upon the Tyne,

  And three upon the Till."


"And what care I for your men? " said she,

  "Or towers from Tyne to Till?

Sith you must go with me," said she,

  "To wait upon my will.    


And you may lead a thousand men

  Nor ever draw the rein,

But before you lead the Fairy Queen

   'Twill burst your heart in twain."


 He has slipped his foot from the stirrup-bar,

   The bridle from his hand,

 And he is bound by hand and foot

   To the Queen of Fairy Land.


"If I have taken the common clay

 And wrought it cunningly

In the shape of a God that was digged a clod,

 The greater honour to me."


"If thou hast taken the common clay,

 And thy hands be not free

From the taint of the soil, thou hast made thy spoil

 The greater shame to thee."


The lark will make her hymn to God,

  The partridge call her brood,

While I forget the heath I trod,

  The fields wherein I stood.


'Tis dule to know not night from morn,

But greater dule to know

I can but hear the hunter's horn

That once I used to blow.


There were three friends that buried the fourth,

The mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes,

And they .went south and east and north--

The strong man fights but the sick man dies.


There were three friends that spoke of the dead--

The strong man fights but the sick man dies--

"And would he were here with us now," they said,

"The Sun in our face and the wind in our eyes."


Yet at the last  ere our spearmen had found him,

Yet at the last, ere a sword-thrust could save,

Yet at the last, with his masters around him,

He spoke of the Faith as a master to slave.

Yet at the last  though the Kafirs had maimed him,

Broken by bondage and wrecked by the river,

Yet at the last, tho' the darkness had claimed him,

He called on Allah  and died a Believer!

Poem 357: The Long Trail


There's a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield,

   And the ricks stand grey to the sun,

Singing: "Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the dover,

   "And your English summer's done."

        You have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,

        And the thresh of the deep-sea rain;

        You have heard the song --  how long? how long?

        Pull out on the trail again!

Ha' done with the Tents of Shem, dear lass,

We've seen the seasons through,

And it's time to turn the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

Pull out, pull out, on the Long Trail-the trail that is always new!


It's North you may run to the rime-ringed sun

   Or South to the blind Hom's hate;

Or East all the way into Mississippi Bay,

   Or West to the Golden Gate --

        Where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,

        And the wildest tales are true,

        And the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        And life runs large on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


The days are sick and cold, and the skies are grey and old

   And the twice-breathed airs blow damp;

And I'd sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll

   Of a black Bilbao tramp,

        With her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,

        And a drunken Dago crew,

        And her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail

        From Cadiz south on the Long Trail-the trail that is always new.


There be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,

   Or the way of a man with a maid;

But the sweetest way to me is a ship's upon the sea

   In the heel of the North-East Trade.

        Can you hear the crash on her brows, dear lass.

        And the drum of the racing screw,

        As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        As she lifts and 'scends on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new?


See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,

   And the fenders grind and heave,

And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,

   And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;

        It's "Gang-plank up and in," dear lass,

        It's "Hawsers warp her through!"

        And it's "All clear aft" on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        We're backing down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,

   And the sirens hoot their dread,

When foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless, viewless deep

   To the sob of the questing lead!

        It's down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,

        With the Grinfleet Sands in view,

        Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light

   That holds the hot sky tame,

And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors

   Where the scared whale flukes in flame!

        Her plates are flaked by the sun, dear lass

        And her ropes are taut with the dew,

        For we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        We're sagging south on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,

   And the shouting seas drive by,

And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,

   And the Southern Cross rides high!

        Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,

        That blaze in the velvet blue.

        They're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

        They're God's own guides on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.


Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start

   We're steaming all too slow,

And it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle

   Where the trumpet-orchids blow!

        You have heard the call of the off-shore wind

        And the voice of the deep-sea rain;

        You have heard the song-how long? how long?

        Pull out on the trail again!


The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,

And The Deuce knows we may do

But we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,

We're down, hull-down, on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new!

Poem 358: The Lost Legion


There's a Legion that never was 'listed,

That carries no colours or crest,

But, split in a thousand detachments,

Is breaking the road for the rest.

Our fathers they left us their blessing --

They taught us, and groomed us, and crammed;

But we've shaken the Clubs and the Messes

To go and find out and be damned

                    (Dear boys!),

To go and get shot and be damned.


So some of us chivy the slaver,

And some of us cherish the black,

And some of us hunt on the Oil Coast,

And some on -- the Wallaby track:

And some of us drift to Sarawak,

And some of us drift up The Fly,

And some share our tucker with tigers,

And some with the gentle Masai

                    (Dear boys!),

Take tea with the giddy Masai.


We've painted The Islands vermilion,

We've pearled on half-shares in the Bay,

We've shouted on seven-ounce nuggets,

We've starved on a Seedeeboy's pay;

We've laughed at the world as we found it --

Its women and cities and men --

From Sayyid Burgash in a tantrum

To the smoke-reddened eyes of Loben

                    (Dear boys!),

We've a little account with Loben.


The ends o' the Earth were our portion,

The ocean at large was our share.

There was never a skirmish to windward

But the Leaderless Legion was there:

Yes, somehow and somewhere and always

We were first when the trouble began,

From a lottery-row in Manila,

To an I.D.B. race on the Pan

                    (Dear boys!),

With the Mounted Police on the Pan.


We preach in advance of the Army,

We skirmish ahead of the Church,

With never a gunboat to help us

When we're scuppered and left in the lurch.

But we know as the cartridges finish,

And we're filed on our last little shelves,

That the Legion that never was 'listed

Will send us as good as ourselves

                    (Good men!),

Five hundred as good as ourselves.


Then a health (we must drink it in whispers)

To our wholly unauthorised horde --

To the line of our dusty foreloopers,

The Gentlemen Rovers abroad --

Yes, a health to ourselves ere we scatter,

For the steamer won't wait for the train,

And the Legion that never was 'listed

Goes back into quarters again!

                    'Regards!

Goes back under canvas again.

                    Hurrah!

The swag and the billy again.

                    Here's how!

The trail and the packhorse again.

                    Salue!

Eyes of grey -- a sodden quay,

Driving rain and falling tears,

As the steamer wears to sea

In a parting storm of cheers.

 Sing, for Faith and Hope are high --

 None so true as you and I --

 Sing the Lovers' Litany:

 "Love like ours can never die!"


Eyes of black -- a throbbing keel,

Milky foam to left and right;

Whispered converse near the wheel

In the brilliant tropic night.

 Cross that rules the Southern Sky!

 Stars that sweep and wheel and fly,

 Hear the Lovers' Litany:

 Love like ours can never die!"


Eyes of brown -- a dusy plain

Split and parched with heat of June,

Flying hoof and tightened rein,

Hearts that beat the old, old tune.

 Side by side the horses fly,

 Frame we now the old reply

 Of the Lovers' Litany:

 "Love like ours can never die!"


Eyes of blue -- the Simla Hills

Silvered with the moonlight hoar;

Pleading of the waltz that thrills,

Dies and echoes round Benmore.

 "Mabel," "Officers," "Good-bye,"

 Glamour, wine, and witchery --

 On my soul's sincerity,

 "Love like ours can never die!"


Maidens of your charity,

Pity my most luckless state.

Four times Cipid's debtor I --

Bankrupt in quadruplicate.

 Yet, despite this evil case,

 And a maiden showed me grace,

 Four-and-forty times would I

 Sing the Lovers' Litany:

Rise to high position through a ready pen.


Boanerges Blitzen argued therefore -- "I,

With the selfsame weapon, can attain as high."

Only he did not possess when he made the trial,

Wicked wit of C-lv-n, irony of L--l.


[Men who spar with Government need, to back their blows,

Something more than ordinary journalistic prose.]


Never young Civilian's prospects were so bright,

Till an Indian paper found that he could write:

Never young Civilian's prospects were so dark,

When the wretched Blitzen wrote to make his mark.


Certainly he scored it, bold, and black, and firm,

In that Indian paper -- made his seniors squirm,

Quated office scandals, wrote the tactless truth --

Was there ever known a more misguided youth?


When the Rag he wrote for praised his plucky game,

Boanerges Blitzen felt that this was Fame;

When the men he wrote of shook their heads and swore,

Boanerges Blitzen only wrote the more:


Posed as Young Ithuriel, resolute and grim,

Till he found promotion didn't come to him;

Till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot,

And his many Districts curiously hot.


Till he found his furlough strangely hard to win,

Boanerges Blitzen didn't care to pin:

Then it seemed to dawn on him something wasn't right --

Boanerges Blitzen put it down to "spite";


Languished in a District desolate and dry;

Watched the Local Government yearly pass him by;

Wondered where the hitch was; called it most unfair.

. . . . .

That was seven years ago -- and he still is there!

Poem 363: The Mare's Nest


Jane Austen Beecher Stowe de Rouse

 Was good beyond all earthly need;

But, on the other hand, her spouse

 Was very, very bad indeed.

He smoked cigars, called churches slow,

And raced -- but this she did not know.


For Belial Machiavelli kept

 The little fact a secret, and,

Though o'er his minor sins she wept,

 Jane Austen did not understand

That Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay

Absorbed one-half her husband's pay.


She was so good, she made hime worse;

 (Some women are like this, I think

He taught her parrot how to curse,

 Her Assam monkey how to drink.

He vexed her righteous soul until

She went up, and he went down hill.


Then came the crisis, strange to say,

 Which turned a good wife to a better.

A telegraphic peon, one day,

 Brought her -- now, had it been a letter

For Belial Machiavelli, I

Know Jane would just have let it lie.


But 'twas a telegram instead,

 Marked "urgent," and her duty plain

To open it. Jane Austen read:

 "Your Lilly's got a cough again.

Can't understand why she is kept

At your expense." Jane Austen wept.


It was a misdirected wire.

 Her husband was at Shaitanpore.

She spread her anger, hot as fire,

 Through six thin foreign sheets or more.

Sent off that letter, wrote another

To her solicitor -- and mother.


Then Belial Machiavelli saw

 Her error and, I trust, his own,

Wired to the minion of the Law,

 And traveled wifeward -- not alone.

For Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay --

Came in a horse-box all the way.


There was a scene -- a weep or two --

 With many kisses. Austen Jane

Rode Lilly all the season through,

 And never opened wires again.

She races now with Belial. This

Is very sad, but so it is.

Poem 364: The Married Man


The bachelor 'e fights for one

 As joyful as can be;

But the married man don't call it fun,

 Because 'e fights for three --

For 'Im an' 'Er an' It

 (An' Two an' One make Three)

'E wants to finish 'is little bit,

 An' e' wants to go 'ome to is tea!


The bachelor pokes up 'is 'ead

 To see if you are gone;

But the married man lies down instead,

 An' waits till the sights come on,

For 'im an' 'Er an' a hit

 (Direct or recochee)

'E wants to finish 'is little bit,

 An' 'e wants to go 'ome to 'is tea.


The bachelor will miss you clear

 To fight another day;

But the married man, 'e says "No fear!"

 'E wants you out of the way

Of 'Im an' 'Er an' It

 (An' 'is road to 'is farm or the sea),

'E wants to finish 'is little bit,

 An' 'e wants to go 'ome to 'is tea.


The bachelor 'e fights 'is fight

 An' streches out an' snores;

But the married man sits up all night --

 For 'e don't like out-o'-doors.

'E'll strain an' listen an' peer

 An' give the first alarm--

For the sake o' the breathin' 'e's used to 'ear,

 An' the 'ead on the thick of 'is arm.


The bachelor may risk 'is 'ide

 To 'elp you when you're downed;

But the married man will wait beside

 Till the ambulance comes round.

'E'll take your 'ome address

 An' all you've time to say,

Or if 'e sees there's 'ope, 'e'll press

 Your art'ry 'alf the day --


For 'Im an' 'Er an' It

 (An' One from Three leaves Two),

For 'e knows you wanted to finish your bit,

 An' 'e knows 'oo's wantin' you.

Yes, 'Im an' 'Er an' It

 (Our 'only One in Three),

We're all of us anxious to finish our bit,

 An' we want to get 'ome to our tea!


Yes, It an' 'Er an' 'Im,

 Which often makes me think

The married man must sink or swim

 An' -- 'e can't afford to sink!

Oh, 'Im an' It an' 'Er

 Since Adam an' Eve began!

So I'd rather fight with the bacheler

 An' be nursed by the married man!

Poem 365: The Masque of Plenty


Argument. -- The Indian Government being minded to discover the economic condition of their lands, sent a Committee to inquire into it; and saw that it was good.



Scene. -- The wooded heights of Simla. The Incarnation of the Government of India in the raiment of the Angel of Plenty signs, to pianoforte accompaniment: --


"How sweet is the shepherd's sweet life!

 From the dawn to the even he strays --

And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

 (adagio dim.) Filled with praise!"


(largendo con sp.) Now this is the position,

                 Go make an inquisition

                 Into their real condition

                   As swiftly as ye may.


             (p) Ay, paint our swarthy billions

                 The richest of vermillions

                 Ere two well-led cotillions

                   Have danced themselves away.


Turkish Patrol, as able and intelligent Investigators wind down the Himalayas: --


What is the state of the Nation? What is its occupation?

Hi! get along, get along, get along -- lend us the information!

Interlude, from Nowhere in Particular, to stringed and Oriental instruments.


Our cattle reel beneath the yoke they bear --

 The earth is iron and the skies are brass --

And faint with fervour of the flaming air

 The languid hours pass.


The well is dry beneath the village tree --

 The young wheat withers ere it reach a span,

And belts of blinding sand show cruelly

 Where once the river ran.


Pray, brothers, pray, but to no earthly King --

 Lift up your hands above the blighted grain,

Look westward -- if they please, the Gods shall bring

 Their mercy with the rain.


Look westward -- bears the blue no brown cloud-bank?

 Nay, it is written -- wherefore should we fly?

On our own field and by our cattle's flank

 Lie down, lie down to die!


Semi-Chorus


By the plumed heads of Kings

Waving high,

Where the tall corn springs

O'er the dead.

If they rust or rot we die,

If they ripen we are fed.

Very mighty is the power of our Kings!


Triumphal return to Simla of the Investigators, attired after

 the manner of Dionysus, leading a pet tiger-cub in wreaths

 of rhubarb-leaves, symbolical of India under medical treatment.

 They sing: --


We have seen, we have written -- behold it, the proof of our manifold toil!

In their hosts they assembled and told it -- the tale of the Sons of the Soil.

We have said of the Sickness -- "Where is it?" -- and of Death -- "It is far from our ken," --

We have paid a particular visit to the affluent children of men.

We have trodden the mart and the well-curb -- we hae stooped to the bield and the byre;

And the King may the forces of Hell curb for the People have all they desire!


Castanets and step-dance: --


Oh, the dom and the mag and the thakur and the thag,

 And the nat and the brinjaree,

And the bunnia and the ryot are as happy and as quiet

And as plump as they can be!


Yes, the jain and the jat in his stucco-fronted hut,

 And the bounding bazugar,

By the favour of the King, are as fat as anything,

 They are -- they are -- they are!


Recitative, Government of India, with white satin wings

   and electro-plated harp: --


How beautiful upon the Mountains -- in peace reclining,

Thus to be assured that our people are unanimously dining.

And though there are places not so blessed as others in naural advantages, which, after all, was only to be expected,

Proud and glad are we to congratulate you upon the work you have thus ably effected.

(Cres.) How be-ewtiful upon the Mountains!


Hired Band, brasses only, full chorus: --


God bless the Squire

And all his rich relations

Who teach us poor people

We eat our proper rations --

We eat our proper rations,

In spite of inundations,

Malarial exhalations,

And casual starvations,

We have, we have, they say we have --

We have our proper rations!


Chorus of the Crystallised Facts


Before the beginning of years

There came to the rule of the State

Men with a pair of shears,

Men with an Estimate --

Strachey with Muir for leaven,

Lytton with locks that fell,

Ripon fooling with Heaven,

And Temple riding like H--ll!

And the bigots took in hand

Cess and the falling of rain,

And the measure of sifted sand

The dealer puts in the grain --

Imports by land and sea,

To uttermost decimal worth,

And registration -- free --

In the houses of death and of birth.

And fashioned with pens and paper,

And fashioned in black and white,

With Life for a flickering taper

And Death for a blazing light --

With the Armed and the Civil Power,

That his strength might endure for a span --

From Adam's Bridge to Peshawur,

The Much Administered Man.


In the towns of the North and the East,

They gathered as unto rule,

They bade him starve his priest

And send his children to school.

Railways and roads they wrought,

For the needs of the soil within;

A time to squabble in court,

A time to bear and to grin.

And gave him peace in his ways,

Jails -- and Police to fight,

Justice -- at length of days,

And Right -- and Might in the Right.

His speech is of mortgaged bedding,

On his kine he borrows yet,

At his heart is his daughter's wedding,

In his eye foreknowledged of debt.

He eats and hath indigestion,

He toils and he may not stop;

His life is a long-drawn question

Between a crop and a crop.

Poem 366: The Master-Cook


With us there rade a Maister-Cook that came

From the Rochelle which is neere Angouleme.

Littel hee was, but rounder than a topp,

And his small berd hadde dipped in manie a soppe,

His honde was smoother than beseemeth mann's,

And his discoorse was all of marzipans,

Of tripes of Caen, or Burdeux snailes swote,

And Seinte Menhoulde wher cooken pigges-foote.

For pyes and fowles and chesnottes hadde hee wonne,

Of hammes of Thuringie colde hee prate,

And well hee knew what Princes hadde on plate

At Christmas-tide, from Artois to Gascogne.

By bred, but meates rost and seethed, and broth,

And purchasable deinties, on mine othe.

Honey and hote gingere well liketh hee,

And whales-flesch mortred with spicerie.

For, lat be all how man denie or carpe,"

And setteth him at boorde with hawkes eyne,

Snuffing what dish is set beforne to deyne,

Nor, till with meate he all--to fill to brim,

None other matter nowher mooveth him.

Most mannes soule is in his bellie most.

For, as man thinketh in his hearte is hee,

But, as hee eateth so his thought shall bee.

And Holie Fader's self (with reveraunce)

Oweth to Cooke his port and his presaunce.

Wherebye it cometh past disputison

Which follow them as schippe her gouvernail.

Poem 367: The Men That Fought at Minden


The men that fought at Minden, they was rookies in their time --

So was them that fought at Waterloo!

All the 'ole command, yuss, from Minden to Maiwand,

They was once dam' sweeps like you!


Then do not be discouraged, 'Eaven is your 'elper,

We'll learn you not to forget;

An' you mustn't swear an' curse, or you'll only catch it worse,

For we'll make you soldiers yet!


The men that fought at Minden, they 'ad stocks beneath their chins,

Six inch 'igh an' more;

But fatigue it was their pride, and they would not be denied

To clean the cook-'ouse floor.


The men that fought at Minden, they had anarchistic bombs

Served to 'em by name of 'and-grenades;

But they got it in the eye (same as you will by-an'-by)

When they clubbed their field-parades.


The men that fought at Minden, they 'ad buttons up an' down,

Two-an'-twenty dozen of 'em told;

But they didn't grouse an' shirk at an hour's extry work,

They kept 'em bright as gold.


The men that fought at Minden, they was armed with musketoons,

Also, they was drilled by 'alberdiers;

I don't know what they were, but the sergeants took good care

They washed be'ind their ears.


The men that fought at Minden, they 'ad ever cash in 'and

Which they did not bank nor save,

But spent it gay an' free on their betters -- such as me --

For the good advice I gave.


The men that fought at Minden, they was civil -- yuss, they was --

Never didn't talk o' rights an' wrongs,

But they got it with the toe (same as you will get it -- so!) --

For interrupting songs.


The men that fought at Minden, they was several other things

Which I don't remember clear;

But that's the reason why, now the six-year men are dry,

The rooks will stand the beer!


Then do not be discouraged, 'Eaven is your 'elper,

We'll learn you not to forget;

An' you mustn't swear an' curse, or you'll only catch it worse,

For we'll make you soldiers yet!


Soldiers yet, if you've got it in you --

All for the sake of the Core;

Soldiers yet, if we 'ave to skin you --

Run an' get the beer, Johnny Raw -- Johnny Raw!

Ho! run an' get the beer, Johnny Raw!

Poem 368: The Merchantmen


King Solomon drew merchantmen,

Because of his desire

For peacocks, apes, and ivory,

From Tarshish unto Tyre:

With cedars out of Lebanon

Which Hiram rafted down,

But we be only sailormen

That use in London Town.


    Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again --

      Where the flaw shall head us or the full Trade suits --

    Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --

      And that's the way we'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!


We bring no store of ingots,

Of spice or precious stones,

But that we have we gathered

With sweat and aching bones:

In flame beneath the tropics,

In frost upon the floe,

And jeopardy of every wind

That does between them go.


And some we got by purchase,

And some we had by trade,

And some we found by courtesy

Of pike and carronade --

At midnight, 'mid-sea meetings,

For charity to keep,

And light the rolling homeward-bound

That rode a foot too deep.


By sport of bitter weather

We're walty, strained, and scarred

From the kentledge on the kelson

To the slings upon the yard.

Six oceans had their will of us

To carry all away --

Our galley's in the Baltic,

And our boom's in Mossel Bay!


We've floundered off the Texel,

Awash with sodden deals,

We've slipped from Valparaiso

With the Norther at our heels:

We've ratched beyond the Crossets

That tusk the Southern Pole,

And dipped our gunnels under

To the dread Agulhas roll.


Beyond all outer charting

We sailed where none have sailed,

And saw the land-lights burning

On islands none have hailed;

Our hair stood up for wonder,

But, when the night was done,

There danced the deep to windward

Blue-empty 'neath the sun!


Strange consorts rode beside us

And brought us evil luck;

The witch-fire climbed our channels,

And flared on vane and truck:

Till, through the red tornado,

That lashed us nigh to blind,

We saw The Dutchman plunging,

Full canvas, head to wind!


We've heard the Midnight Leadsman

That calls the black deep down --

Ay, thrice we've heard The Swimmer,

The Thing that may not drown.

On frozen bunt and gasket

The sleet-cloud drave her hosts,

When, manned by more than signed with us,

We passed the Isle o' Ghosts!


And north, amid the hummocks,

A biscuit-toss below,

We met the silent shallop

That frighted whalers know;

For, down a cruel ice-lane,

That opened as he sped,

We saw dead Henry Hudson

Steer, North by West, his dead.


So dealt God's waters with us

Beneath the roaring skies,

So walked His signs and marvels

All naked to our eyes:

But we were heading homeward

With trade to lose or make --

Good Lord, they slipped behind us

In the tailing of our wake!


Let go, let go the anchors;

Now shamed at heart are we

To bring so poor a cargo home

That had for gift the sea!

Let go the great bow-anchors --

Ah, fools were we and blind --

The worst we stored with utter toil,

The best we left behind!


    Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again,

      Whither flaw shall fail us or the Trades drive down:

    Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --

      And all to bring a cargo up to London Town!

Dawn off the Foreland--the young flood making

 Jumbled and short and steep--

Black in the hollows and bright where it's breaking--

 Awkward water to sweep.

 "Mines reported in the fairway,

 Warn all traffic and detain.

Sent up Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden

Gain."


Noon off the Foreland--the first ebb making

 Lumpy and strong in the bight.

Boom after boom, and the golf-hut shaking

 And the jackdaws wild with fright.

 "Mines located in the fairway,

 Boats now working up the chain,

Sweepers--Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden

Gain."


Dusk off the Foreland--the last light going

 And the traffic crowding through,

And five damned trawlers with their syreens blowing

 Heading the whole review!

 "Sweep completed in the fairway.

 No more mines remain.

Sent back Unity, Claribel, Assyrian, Stormcock, and Golden

Gain."

Poem 371: The Miracles


I sent a message to my dear --

A thousand leagues and more to Her --

The dumb sea-levels thrilled to hear,

And Lost Atlantis bore to Her.


Behind my message hard I came,

And nigh had found a grave for me;

But that I launched of steel and flame

Did war against the wave for me.


Uprose the deep, by gale on gale,

To bid me change my mind again --

He broke his teeth along my rail,

And, roaring, swung behind again.


I stayed the sun at noon to tell

My way across the waste of it;

I read the storm before it fell

And made the better haste of it.


Afar, I hailed the land at night --

The towers I built had heard of me --

And, ere my rocket reached its height,

Had flashed my Love the word of me.


Earth sold her chosen men of strength

(They lived and strove and died for me)

To drive my road a nation's length,

And toss the miles aside for me.


I snatched their toil to serve my needs --

Too slow their fleetest flew for me --

I tired twenty smoking steeds,

And bade them bait a new for me.


I sent the lightnings forth to see

Where hour by hour She waited me.

Among ten million one was She,

And surely all men hated me!


Dawn ran to meet me at my goal --

Ah, day no tongue shall tell again!

And little folk of little soul

Rose up to buy and sell again!

Sainted Diana! can that be

 The Moon of Other Days?


Ah! shade of little Kitty Smith,

 Sweet Saint of Kensington!

Say, was it ever thus at Home

 The Moon of August shone,

When arm in arm we wandered long

 Through Putney's evening haze,

And Hammersmith was Heaven beneath

 The moon of Other Days?


But Wandle's stream is Sutlej now,

 And Putney's evening haze

The dust that half a hundered kine

 Before my window raise.

Unkempt, unclean, athwart the mist

 The seething city looms,

In place of Putney's golden gorse

 The sickly babul blooms.


Glare down, old Hecate, through the dust,

 And bid the pie-dog yell,

Draw from the drain its typhoid-term,

 From each bazaar its smell;

Yea, suck the fever from the tank

 And sap my strength therewith:

Thank Heaven, you show a smiling face

 To little Kitty Smith!

Poem 373: The Morning Song of the Jungle


One moment past our bodies cast

 No shadow on the plain;

Now clear and black they stride our track,

 And we run home again.

In morning-hush, each rock and bush

 Stands hard, and high, and raw:

Then give the Call:  "Good rest to all

 That keep the Jungle Law!"


Now horn and pelt our peoples melt

 In covert to abide;

Now, crouched and still, to cave and hill

 Our Jungle Barons glide.

Now, stark and plain, Man's oxen strain,

 That draw the new-yoked plough;

Now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red

 Above the lit talao.


Ho! Get to lair! The sun's aflare

 Behind the breathing grass:

And creaking through the young bamboo

 The warning whispers pass.

By day made strange, the woods we range

 With blinking eyes we scan;

While down the skies the wild duck cries:

 "The Day--the Day to Man!"


The dew is dried that drenched our hide,

 Or washed about our way;

And where we drank, the puddled bank

 Is crisping into clay.

The traitor Dark gives up each mark

 Of stretched or hooded claw:

Then hear the Call: "Good rest to all

 That keep the Jungle Law!"

I have a dream -- a dreadful dream --

 A dream that is never done.

I watch a man go out of his mind,

 And he is My Mother's Son.


They pushed him into a Mental Home,

 And that is like the grave:

For they do not let you sleep upstairs,

 And you aren't allowed to shave.


And it was not disease or crime

 Which got him landed there,

But because They laid on My Mother's Son

 More than a man could bear.


What with noise, and fear of death,

 Waking, and wounds and cold,

They filled the Cup for My Mother's Son

 Fuller than it could hold.


They broke his body and his mind

 And yet They made him live,

And They asked more of My Mother's Son

 Than any man could give.


For, just because he had not died,

 Nor been discharged nor sick,

They dragged it out with My Mother's Son

 Longer than he could stick....


And no one knows when he'll get well --

 So, there he'll have to be:

And, 'spite of the beard in the looking-glass,

  I know that man is me!

    They change their skies above them,

      But not their hearts that roam!

    We learned from our wistful mothers

      To call old England "home";

    We read of the English skylark,

      Of the spring in the English lanes,

    But we screamed with the painted lories

      As we rode on the dusty plains!


    They passed with their old-world legends --

      Their tales of wrong and dearth --

    Our fathers held by purchase,

      But we by the right of birth;

    Our heart's where they rocked our cradle,

      Our love where we spent our toil,

    And our faith and our hope and our honour

      We pledge to our native soil!


    I charge you charge your glasses --

      I charge you drink with me

    To the men of the Four New Nations,

      And the Islands of the Sea --

    To the last least lump of coral

      That none may stand outside,

    And our own good pride shall teach us

      To praise our comrade's pride!


To the hush of the breathless morning

On the thin, tin, crackling roofs,

To the haze of the burned back-ranges

And the dust of the shoeless hoofs --

To the risk of a death by drowning,

To the risk of a death by drouth --

To the men of a million acres,

To the Sons of the Golden South!


    To the Sons of the Golden South (Stand up!),

      And the life we live and know,

    Let a fellow sing o' the little things he cares about,

    If a fellow fights for the little things he cares about

      With the weight of a single blow!


To the smoke of a hundred coasters,

To the sheep on a thousand hills,

To the sun that never blisters,

To the rain that never chills --

To the land of the waiting spring-time,

To our five-meal, meat-fed men,

To the tall, deep-bosomed women,

And the children nine and ten!


    And the children nine and ten (Stand up!),

      And the life we live and know,

    Let a fellow sing o' the little things he cares about,

    If a fellow fights for the little things he cares about

      With the weight of a two-fold blow!


To the far-flung fenceless prairie

Where the quick cloud-shadows trail,

To our neighbour's barn in the offing

And the line of the new-cut rail;

To the plough in her league-long furrow

With the gray Lake gulls behind --

To the weight of a half-year's winter

And the warm wet western wind!


To the home of the floods and thunder,

To her pale dry healing blue --

To the lift of the great Cape combers,

And the smell of the baked Karroo.

To the growl of the sluicing stamp-head --

To the reef and the water-gold,

To the last and the largest Empire,

To the map that is half unrolled!


To our dear dark foster-mothers,

To the heathen songs they sung --

To the heathen speech we babbled

Ere we came to the white man's tongue.

To the cool of our deep verandas --

To the blaze of our jewelled main,

To the night, to the palms in the moonlight,

And the fire-fly in the cane!


To the hearth of our people's people --

To her well-ploughed windy sea,

To the hush of our dread high-altar

Where The Abbey makes us We;

To the grist of the slow-ground ages,

To the gain that is yours and mine --

To the Bank of the Open Credit,

To the Power-house of the Line!


We've drunk to the Queen -- God bless her! --

We've drunk to our mothers' land;

We've drunk to our English brother

(And we hope he'll understand).

We've drunk as much as we're able,

And the Cross swings low for the morn;

Last toast -- and your foot on the table! --

A health to the Native-born!


    A health to the Native-born (Stand up!),

      We're six white men arow,

    All bound to sing o' the little things we care about,

    All bound to fight for the little things we care about

      With the weight of a six-fold blow!

    By the might of our cable-tow (Take hands!),

      From the Orkneys to the Horn,

    All round the world (and a little loop to pull it by),

    All round the world (and a little strap to buckle it),

      A health to the Native-born!

Poem 377: The Naulahka


There was a strife 'twixt man and maid--

Oh, that was at the birth of time!

But what befell 'twixt man and maid,

Oh, that's beyond the grip of rhyme.

'Twas "Sweet, I must not bide with you,"

And, "Love, I cannot bide alone";

For both were young and both were true.

And both were hard as the nether stone.


Beware the man who's crossed in love;

 For pent-up steam must find its vent.

Stand back when he is on the move,

 And lend him all the Continent.


Your patience, Sirs. The Devil took me up

To the burned mountain over Sicily

(Fit place for me) and thence I saw my Earth--

(Not all Earth's splendour, 'twas beyond my need--)

And that one spot I love--all Earth to me,

And her I love, my Heaven. What said I?

My love was safe from all the powers of Hell-

For you--e'en you--acquit her of my guilt--

But Sula, nestling by our sail--specked sea,

My city, child of mine, my heart, my home--

Mine and my pride--evil might visit there!

It was for Sula and her naked port,

Prey to the galleys of the Algerine,

Our city Sula, that I drove my price--

For love of Sula and for love of her.

The twain were woven--gold on sackcloth--twined

Past any sundering till God shall judge

The evil and the good.

Now it is not good for the Christian's health to hustle the Aryan

    brown,

For the Christian riles, and the Aryan smiles and he weareth the

    Christian down;

And the end of the fight is a tombstone white with the name of

     the  late  deceased,

And the epitaph drear:  "A Fool lies here who tried to hustle the

      East."


There is pleasure in the wet, wet clay

When the artist's hand is  potting it.

There is pleasure in the wet, wet lay --

When the poet's pad is blotting it.

There is pleasure in the shine of your picture on the line

At the Royal Acade-my;

But the pleasure felt in these is as chalk to Cheddar cheese

When it comes to a well-made Lie--


To a quite unwreckable Lie,

To a most impeccable Lie!

To  a water-right,  fire-proof,  angle-iron,  sunk-hinge,  time-lock,

        steel-faced Lie!

Not a private handsome Lie,

But a pair-and-brougham Lie,

Not a little-place-at-Tooting, but a country-house-with-shooting

And a ring-fence-deer-park Lie.


              When a lover hies abroad

              Looking for his love,

              Azrael smiling sheathes his sword,

              Heaven smiles above.

              Earth and sea

              His servants be,

              And to lesser compass round,

              That his love be sooner found!


                We meet in an evil land

                That is near to the gates of Hell.

                I wait for thy command

                To serve, to speed or withstand.

                And thou sayest I do not well?


           Oh Love, the flowers so red

            Are only tongues of flame,

           The earth is full of the dead,

           The new-killed, restless dead.

           There is danger beneath and o'erhead,

            And I guard thy gates in fear

            Of words thou canst not hear,

            Of peril and jeopardy,

            Of signs thou canst not see--

.            And thou sayest 'tis ill that I came?


          This I saw when the rites were done,

          And the lamps were dead and the Gods alone,

          And the grey snake coiled on the altar stone--

          Ere I fled from a Fear that I could not see,

          And the Gods of the East made mouths at me.


 Beat off in our last fight were we?

 The greater need to seek the sea.

 For Fortune changeth as the moon

 To caravel and picaroon.

 Then Eastward Ho! or Westward Ho!

 Whichever wind may meetest blow.

  Our quarry sails on either sea,

  Fat prey for such bold lads as we,

  And every sun-dried buccaneer

  Must hand and reef and watch and steer,

  And bear great wrath of sea and sky

  Before the plate-ships wallow by.

  Now, as our tall bows take the foam,

  Let no man turn his heart to home,

  Save to desire plunder more

  And larger warehouse for his store,

  When treasure won from Santos Bay

  Shall make our sea-washed village gay.


     Because I sought it far from men,

     In deserts and alone,

     I found it burning overhead,

     The jewel of a Throne.


      Because I sought--I sought it so

      And spent my days to find--

      It blazed one moment ere it left

      The blacker night behind.


     We be the Gods of the East--

        Older than all--

     Masters of Mourning and Feast--

        How shall we fall?


Will they gape for the husks that ye proffer

 Or yearn to your song

And we--have we nothing to offer

 Who ruled them so long--

In the fume of incense, the clash of the cymbals, the blare of

 the conch and the gong?

Over the strife of the schools

 Low the day burns--

Back with the kine from the pools

 Each one returns

To the life that he knows where the  altar-flame glows and the

 tulsi is trimmed in the urns.

Poem 378: The Necessitarian


I know not in Whose hands are laid

To empty upon earth

From unsuspected ambuscade

The very Urns of Mirth;


Who bids the Heavenly Lark arise

 And cheer our solemn round--

The Jest beheld with streaming eyes

 And grovellings on the ground;


Who joins the flats of Time and Chance

  Behind the prey preferred,

And thrones on Shrieking Circumstance

 The Sacredly Absurd,


Till Laughter, voiceless through excess,

 Waves mute appeal and sore,

Above the midriff's deep distress,

 For breath to laugh once more.


No creed hath dared to hail Him Lord,

 No raptured choirs proclaim,

And Nature's strenuous Overword

 Hath nowhere breathed His Name.


Yet, it must be, on wayside jape,

 The selfsame Power bestows

The selfsame power as went to shape

 His Planet or His Rose.

And I heard her propellers roar- "Write to poor fellers

Poem 381: The Nursing Sister


Our sister sayeth such and such,

And we must bow to her behests.

Our little maid that hath no breasts.

A flower withheld from sun or bee,

An alien in the Courts of Love,

And--teacher unto such as we!


We love her, but we laugh the while,

We laugh, but sobs are mixed with laughter;

Our sister hath no time to smile,

She knows not what must follow after.


Wind of the South, arise and blow,

From beds of spice thy locks shake free;

Breathe on her heart that she may know,

Breathe on her eyes that she may see!


Alas! we vex her with our mirth,

And maze her with most tender scorn,

Who stands beside the Gates of Birth,

Herself a child--a child unborn!


Our sister sayeth such and such,

And we must bow to her behests.

Our sister toileth overmuch,

Poem 382: The Old Issue


Here is nothing new nor aught unproven," say the Trumpets,

"Many feet have worn it and the road is old indeed.

"It is the King--the King we schooled aforetime! "

(Trumpets in the marshes-in the eyot at Runnymede!)


"Here is neither haste, nor hate, nor anger," peal the Trumpets,

 "Pardon for his penitence or pity for his fall.

"It is the King!"--inexorable Trumpets--

(Trumpets round the scaffold af the dawning by Whitehall!)



"He hath veiled the Crown And hid the Scepter," warn (he Trum pets,

 "He hath changed the fashion of the lies that cloak his will.

"Hard die the Kings--ah hard--dooms hard!" declare the Trumpets,

Trumpets at the gang-plank where the brawling troop-decks fill!


Ancient and Unteachable, abide--abide the Trumpets!

 Once again the Trumpets, for the shuddering ground-swell brings  

Clamour over ocean of the harsh, pursuing Trumpets--

 Trumpets of the Vanguard that have sworn no truce with Kings!          


All we have of freedom, all we use or know--

This our fathers bought for us long and long ago.


Ancient Right unnoticed as the breath we draw--

Leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the Law.


Lance and torch and tumult, steel and grey-goose wing

Wrenched it, inch and ell and all, slowly from the king.


Till our fathers 'stablished,, after bloody years,          

How our King is one with us, first among his peers.


So they bought us freedom-not at little cost--        

Wherefore must we watch the King, lest our gain be lost.


Over all things certain, this is sure indeed,

Suffer not the old King: for we know the breed.


Give no ear to bondsmen bidding us endure.

Whining "He is weak and far"; crying "Time will cure."


(Time himself is witness, till the battle joins,

Deeper strikes the rottenness in the people's loins.)


Give no heed to bondsmen masking war with peace.

Suffer not the old King here or overseas.


They that beg us barter--wait his yielding mood--

Pledge  the  years  we  hold  in  trust-pawn  our  brother's blood--


Howso' great their clamour, whatsoe'er their claim,

Suffer not the old King under any name!


Here is naught unproven--here is naught to learn.

It is written what shall  fall if  the King return.


He shall mark our goings, question whence we came,

Set his guards about us, as in Freedom's name.


He shall take a tribute, toll of all our ware;

He shall change our gold for arms--arms we may not bear.


He shall break his Judges if they cross his word;

He shall rule above the Law calling on the Lord.


He shall peep and mutter; and the night shall bring

Watchers 'neath our window, lest we mock the King --


Hate and all division; hosts of hurrying spies;

Money poured in secret, carrion breeding flies.


Strangers of his counsel, hirelings of his pay,

These shall deal our Justice: sell-deny-delay.


We shall drink dishonour, we shall eat abuse

For the Land we look to--for the Tongue we use.


We shall take our station, dirt beneath his feet,

While his hired captains jeer us in the street.


Cruel in the shadow, crafty in the sun,

Far beyond his borders shall his teachings run.


Sloven, sullen, savage, secret, uncontrolled,

Laying on a new land evil of the old--


Long-forgotten bondage, dwarfing heart and brain--

All our fathers died to loose he shall bind again.


Here is nought at venture, random nor untrue

Swings the wheel full-circle, brims the cup anew.


Here is naught unproven, here is nothing hid:

Step for step and word for word--so the old Kings did!


Step by step, and word by word: who is ruled may read.

Suffer not the old Kings:  for we know the breed--


All the right they promise--all the wrong they bring.

Stewards of the Judgment, suffer not this King!

 Why do you thrill when you hear it?

Screened from knowledge or shame or care,

 In the night that it made around you!"

Poem 384: The Only Son


She dropped the bar, she shot the bolt, she fed the fire anew

  For she heard  a whimper under the  sill  and  a  great grey paw came through.

  The fresh flame comforted the hut and shone on the roof-beam,

  And the Only Son lay down again and dreamed that he dreamed a dream.

  The last ash fell from the withered log with the click of a falling spark,

  And the Only Son woke up again, and called across the dark:--

  "Now was I born of womankind and laid in a mother's breast?

  For I have dreamed of a shaggy hide whereon I went to rest.

  And was I born of womankind and laid on a father's arm?

  For I have dreamed of clashing teeth that guarded me from harm.


  And was I born an Only Son and did I play alone?

  For I have dreamed of comrades twain that bit me to the bone.

  And did I break the barley-cake and steep it in the tyre?

  For I have dreamed of a youngling kid new-riven from the byre:

  For I  have  dreamed  of a midnight sky  and  a  midnight call to blood

  And red-mouthed shadows racing by, that thrust me from my food.

  'Tis an hour yet and an hour yet to the rising of the moon,

  But I can see the black roof-tree as plain as it were noon.

  'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the trooping blackbuck go;

  But I can hear the little fawn that bleats behind the doe.



  'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the crop and the upland meet,

  But I Can smell the  wet dawn-wind  that wakes  the sprouting wheat.

  Unbar the door. I may not bide, but I must out and see

  If those are wolves that wait outside or my own kin to me!"

  She loosed the bar,  she slid the bolt, she opened the door anon,

  And a grey bitch-wolf came out of the dark and fawned on the Only Son!

 They set themselves to find

Fresh terrors and undreamed-of fears

 To heap upon mankind.

 Or digged from earth beneath,

They laid into their treasure-trove

 And arsenals of death:


While, for well-weighed advantage sake,

 Ruler and ruled alike

Built up the faith they meant to break

 When the fit hour should strike.


They traded with the careless earth,

 And good return it gave:

They plotted by their neighbour's hearth

 The means to make him slave.


When all was ready to their hand

 They loosed their hidden sword,

And utterly laid waste a land

 Their oath was pledged to guard.


Coldly they went about to raise

 To life and make more dread

Abominations of old days,

 That men believed were dead.


They paid the price to reach their goal

 Across a world in flame;

But their own hate slew their own soul

 Before that victory came.

Poem 387: The Overland Mail


In the name of the Empress of India, make way,

 O Lords of the Jungle, wherever you roam.

The woods are astir at the close of the day --

 We exiles are waiting for letters from Home.

Let the robber retreat -- let the tiger turn tail --

In the Name of the Empress, the Overland Mail!


With a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in,

 He turns to the foot-path that heads up the hill --

The bags on his back and a cloth round his chin,

 And, tucked in his waist-belt, the Post Office bill:

"Dispatched on this date, as received by the rail,

Per runner, two bags of the Overland Mail."


Is the torrent in spate? He must ford it or swim.

 Has the rain wrecked the road? He must climb by the cliff.

Does the tempest cry "Halt"? What are tempests to him?

 The Service admits not a "but" or and "if."

While the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail,

In the Name of the Empress, the Overland Mail.


From aloe to rose-oak, from rose-oak to fir,

 From level to upland, from upland to crest,

From rice-field to rock-ridge, from rock-ridge to spur,

 Fly the soft sandalled feet, strains the brawny brown chest.

From rail to ravine -- to the peak from the vale --

Up, up through the night goes the Overland Mail.


There's a speck on the hillside, a dot on the road --

 A jingle of bells on the foot-path below --

There's a scuffle above in the monkey's abode --

 The world is awake, and the clouds are aglow.

For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail:

"In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail!"

Poem 388: The Palace


When I was a King and a Mason -- a Master proven and skilled --

I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build.

I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently, under the silt,

I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.


There was no worth in the fashion -- there was no wit in the plan --

Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran --

Masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone:

"After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known."


Swift to my use in my trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew,

I tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew.

Lime I milled of his marbles; burned it, slacked it, and spread;

Taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead.


Yet I despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart,

I read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder's heart.

As he had risen and pleaded, so did I understand

The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned.



When I was a King and a Mason -- in the open noon of my pride,

They sent me a Word from the Darkness. They whispered and called me aside.

They said -- "The end is forbidden." They said -- "Thy use is fulfilled.

"Thy Palace shall stand as that other's -- the spoil of a King who shall build."


I called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and my sheers.

All I had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years.

Only I cut on the timber -- only I carved on the stone:

"After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known!"

Poem 389: The Peace of Dives


The Word came down to Dives in Torment where he lay:

"Our World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,

 "And the Saint and Seer and Prophet

 "Can make no better of it

"Than to sanctify and prophesy and pray.


"Rise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,

"And thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.

 "It may be grace hath found thee

 "In the furnace where We bound thee,

"And that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold."


Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,

And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lord's desire;

 And anon the battles ceased,

 And the captives were released,

And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire.


The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,

'Mid the shouring of the peoples by the cannon overthrown

 (But the Prophets, Saints, and Seers

 Set each other by the ears,

For each would claim the marvel as his own):


"Rise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,

"And prove the Peace of Dives if it be good or no:

 "For all that he hath planned

 "We deliver to thy hand,

"As thy skill shall serve, to break it or bring low."


Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,

And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride.

 But for all the wrong he breathed

 There was never sword unsheathed,

And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.


Then terribly 'rose Satan, and darkened Earth afar,

Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;

 And he saw men pledge their gear

 For the bold that buys the spear,

And the helmet and the habergeon of war.


Yea, to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Mede --

And their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their greed --

 And they pledged their flocks and farms

 For the King-compelling arms,

And Dives lent according to their need.


Then Satan said to Dives: -- "Return again with me,

"Who hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,

  "Who grindest for thy greed

  "Man's belly-pinch and need,

"And the blood of Man to filthy usury!"


Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit: --

"My Refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit.

 "But behold all Earth is laid

 "In the Peace which I have made,

"And behold I wait on thee to trouble it!"


Then angrily turned Satan, and about the Seas he fled,

To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;

 But, for all the sleight he used,

 There was never squadron loosed,

And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.


But to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the West --

And their hates were nothing weakened nor their angers unrest --

 And they pawned their utmost trade

 For the dry, decreeing blade;

And Dives lent and took of them their best.


Then Satan said to Dives: -- "Declare thou by The Name,

"The secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame.

 "It is known through all the Hells

 "How my peoples mocked my spells,

"And my faithless Kings denied me ere I came."


Then answered cunning Dives: "Do not gold and hate abide

"At the heart of every Magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?

 "With gold and fear and hate

 "I have harnessed state to state,

"And by hate and fear and gold their hates are tied.


"For hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shield --

"Keener blades and broader targets than their frantic neighbours wield --

 "For gold I arm their hands,

 "And for gold I buy their lands,

"And for gold I sell their enemies the yield.


"Their nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may lease,

"One by one from Ancient Accad to the Islands of the Seas.

"The flocks that Egypt pledged me to Assyria I drave,

"And Pharaoh hath the increase of the herds that Sargon gave.

 "Not for Ashdod overthrown

 "Will the Kings destroy their own,

"Or their peoples wake the strife they feign to brave.


"Is not Carchemish like Calno? For the steeds of their desire

"They have sold me seven harvests that I sell to Crowning Tyre;

"So I make a jest of Wonder, and a mock of Time and Space,

"The roofless Seas an hostel, and the Earth a market-place,

 "Where the anxious traders know

 "Each is surety for his foe,

"And none may thrive without his fellows' grace.


"Now this is all my subtlety and this is all my Wit,

Poem 390: The Penalty


Once in life I watched a Star;

 But I whistled, "Let her go!

There are others, fairer far,

 Which my favouring skies shall show

Here I lied, and herein I

Stood to pay the penalty.


Marvellous the Planets shone  

 As I ranged from coast to coast--

But beyond comparison

 Rode the Star that I had lost.

I had lied, and only I

Did not guess the penalty!  .  .  .


When  my  Heavens  were  turned  to  blood,

 When the dark had filled my day,

Furthest, but most faithful, stood

 That lone Star I cast away.

I had loved myself, and I

Have not lived and dare not die!

Poem 391: The Pirates in England


When Rome was rotten-ripe to her fall,

     And the sceptre passed from her hand,

   The pestilent Picts leaped over the wall

     To harry the English land.


   The little dark men of the mountain and waste,

     So quick to laughter and tears,

   They came panting with hate and haste

     For the loot of five hundred years.


   They killed the trader, they sacked the shops,

     They ruined temple and town--

   They swept like wolves through the standing crops

     Crying that Rome was down.


   They wiped out all that they could find

     Of beauty and strength and worth,

   But they could not wipe out the Viking's Wind

     That brings the ships from the North.


   They could not wipe out the North-East gales

     Nor what those gales set free--

   The pirate ships with their close-reefed sails,

     Leaping from sea to sea.


   They had forgotten the shield-hung hull

     Seen nearer and more plain,

   Dipping into the troughs like a gull,

     And gull-like rising again--


   The painted eyes that glare and frown

     In the high snake-headed stem,

   Searching the beach while her sail comes down,

     They had forgotten them!


   There was no Count of the Saxon Shore

     To meet her hand to hand,

   As she took the beach with a grind and a roar,

     And the pirates rushed inland!

Poem 392: The Playmate


She is not Folly -- that I know.

Her steadfast eyelids tell me so

When, at the hour the lights divide,

She steals as summonsed to my side.


When, finger on the pursed lip

In secret, mirthful fellowship,

She, heralding new -- framed delights,

Breathes, "This shall be a Night of Nights!"


Then, out of Time and out of Space,

Is built an Hour and a Place

Where all an earnest, baffled Earth

Blunders and trips to make us mirth;


Whence from the trivial flux of Things,

Rise inconceived miscarryings,

Outrageous but immortal, shown,

Of Her great love, to me alone...


She is not Wisdom, but, maybe,

Wiser than all the Norns is She:

And more than Wisdom I prefer

To wait on Her, -- to wait on Her!

Poem 393: The Plea of the Simla Dancers


Too late, alas! the song

   To remedy the wrong; --

The rooms are taken from us, swept and

     garnished for their fate.

   But these tear-besprinkled pages

   Shall attest to future ages

That we cried against the crime of it --

     too late, alas! too late!



"What have we ever done to bear this grudge?"

 Was there no room save only in Benmore

For docket, duftar, and for office drudge,

 That you usurp our smoothest dancing floor?

Must babus do their work on polished teak?

 Are ball-rooms fittest for the ink you spill?

Was there no other cheaper house to seek?

 You might have left them all at Strawberry Hill.


We never harmed you! Innocent our guise,

 Dainty our shining feet, our voices low;

And we revolved to divers melodies,

 And we were happy but a year ago.

To-night, the moon that watched our lightsome wiles --

 That beamed upon us through the deodars --

Is wan with gazing on official files,

 And desecrating desks disgust the stars.


Nay! by the memory of tuneful nights --

 Nay! by the witchery of flying feet --

Nay! by the glamour of foredone delights --

 By all things merry, musical, and meet --

By wine that sparkled, and by sparkling eyes --

 By wailing waltz -- by reckless gallop's strain --

By dim verandas and by soft replies,

 Give us our ravished ball-room back again!


Or -- hearken to the curse we lay on you!

 The ghosts of waltzes shall perplex your brain,

And murmurs of past merriment pursue

 Your 'wildered clerks that they indite in vain;

And when you count your poor Provincial millions,

 The only figures that your pen shall frame

Shall be the figures of dear, dear cotillions

 Danced out in tumult long before you came.


Yea! "See Saw" shall upset your estimates,

 "Dream Faces" shall your heavy heads bemuse,

Because your hand, unheeding, desecrates

 Our temple; fit for higher, worthier use.

And all the long verandas, eloquent

 With echoes of a score of Simla years,

Shall plague you with unbidden sentiment --

 Babbling of kisses, laughter, love, and tears.


So shall you mazed amid old memories stand,

 So shall you toil, and shall accomplish nought,

And ever in your ears a phantom Band

 Shall blare away the staid official thought.

Wherefore -- and ere this awful curse he spoken,

 Cast out your swarthy sacrilegious train,

And give -- ere dancing cease and hearts be broken --

 Give us our ravished ball-room back again!

Poem 394: The Portent


Oh, late withdrawn from human-kind

 And following dreams we never knew!

Varus, what dream has Fate assigned

 To trouble you?


Such virtue as commends of law

 Of Virtue to the vulgar horde

Suffices not. You needs must draw

 A righteous sword;


And, flagrant in well-doing, smite

 The priests of Bacchus at their fane,

Lest any worshipper invite

 The God again.


Whence public strife and naked crime

 And-deadlier than the cup you shun--

A people schooled to mock, in time,

 All law--not one.


Cease, then, to fashion State-made sin,

 Nor give thy children cause to doubt

That Virtue springs from Iron within--

 Not lead without.

Poem 395: The Post That Fitted


Though tangled and twisted the course of true love

This ditty explains,

No tangle's so tangled it cannot improve

If the Lover has brains.



Ere the seamer bore him Eastward, Sleary was engaged to marry

An attractive girl at Tunbridge, whom he called "my little Carrie."

Sleary's pay was very modest; Sleary was the other way.

Who can cook a two-plate dinner on eight poor rupees a day?


Long he pondered o'er the question in his scantly furnished quarters --

Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin, eldest of Judge Boffkin's daughters.

Certainly an impecunious Subaltern was not a catch,

But the Boffkins knew that Minnie mightn't make another match.


So they recognised the business and, to feed and clothe the bride,

Got him made a Something Something somewhere on the Bombay side.

Anyhow, the billet carried pay enough for him to marry --

As the artless Sleary put it: -- "Just the thing for me and Carrie."


Did he, therefore, jilt Miss Boffkin -- impulse of a baser mind?

No! He started epileptic fits of an appalling kind.

[Of his modus operandi only this much I could gather: --

"Pears's shaving sticks will give you little taste and lots of lather."]


Frequently in public places his affliction used to smite

Sleary with distressing vigour -- always in the Boffkins' sight.

Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly returned his ring,

Told him his "unhappy weakness" stopped all thought of marrying.


Sleary bore the information with a chastened holy joy, --

Epileptic fits don't matter in Political employ, --

Wired three short words to Carrie -- took his ticket, packed his kit --

Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in one last, long, lingering fit.


Four weeks later, Carrie Sleary read -- and laughed until she wept --

Mrs. Boffkin's warning letter on the "wretched epilept." . . .

Year by year, in pious patience, vengeful Mrs. Boffkin sits

Waiting for the Sleary babies to develop Sleary's fits.

Poem 397: The Power of the Dog


There is sorrow enough in the natural way

From men and women to fill our day;

And when we are certain of sorrow in store,

Why do we always arrange for more?

Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware

Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.


Buy a pup and your money will buy

Love unflinching that cannot lie--

Perfect passion and worship fed

By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.

Nevertheless it is hardly fair

To risk your heart for a dog to tear.


When the fourteen years which Nature permits

Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,

And the vet's unspoken prescription runs

To lethal chambers or loaded guns,

Then you will find--it's your own affair--

But...you've given your heart for a dog to tear.


When the body that lived at your single will,

With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!);

When the spirit that answered your every mood

Is gone--wherever it goes--for good,

You will discover how much you care,

And will give your heart for the dog to tear.


We've sorrow enough in the natural way,

When it comes to burying Christian clay.

Our loves are not given, but only lent,

At compound interest of cent per cent.

Though it is not always the case, I believe,

That the longer we've kept 'em, the more do we grieve:

For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,

A short-time loan is as bad as a long--

So why in Heaven (before we are there)

Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?

Poem 398: The Prairie


I see the grass shake in the sun for leagues on either hand,

I see a river loop and run about a treeless land --

An empty plain, a steely pond, a distance diamond-clear,

And low blue naked hills beyond. And what is that to fear?"


"Go softly by that river-side or, when you would depart,

You'll find its every winding tied and knotted round your heart.

Be wary as the seasons pass, or you may ne'er outrun

The wind that sets that yellowed grass a-shiver 'neath the Sun."


I hear the summer storm outblown -- the drip of the grateful wheat.

I hear the hard trail telephone a far-off horse's feet.

I hear the horns of Autumn blow to the wild-fowl overhead;

And I hear the hush before the snow. And what is that to dread?"


"Take heed what spell the lightning weaves -- what charm the echoes shape --

Or, bound among a million sheaves, your soul shall not escape.

Bar home the door of summer nights lest those high planets drown

The memory of near delights in all the longed-for town."


"What need have I to long or fear? Now, friendly, I behold

My faithful seasons robe the year in silver and in gold.

Now I possess and am possessed of the land where I would be,

And the curve of half Earth's generous breast shall soothe and ravish me!"

From the wheel and the drift of Things

           Deliver us, Good Lord,

           O'ertrod by trampling stars.

           The Soul escaped alone.


           Thy Path, thy Purposes conceal

            From our beleaguered realm

            Lest any shattering whisper steal

            Upon us and o'erwhelm.

The Soldier may forget his Sword,

The Sailor man the Sea,

The Mason may forget the Word

And the Priest his Litany:

The Maid may forget both jewel and gem,

And the Bride her wedding-dress--

But the Jew shall forget Jerusalem

Ere we forget the Press!


Who once hath stood through the loaded hour

Ere, roaring like the gale,

The Harold and the Hoe devour

Their league-long paper-bale,

And has lit his pipe in the morning calm

That follows the midnight stress--

He hath sold his heart to the old Black Art

We call the daily Press.


Who once hath dealt in the widest game

That all of a man can play,

No later love, no larger fame

Will lure him long away.

As the war-horse snuffeth the battle afar,

 The entered Soul, no less,

He saith: "Ha! Ha!" where the trumpets are

 And the thunders of the Press!


Canst thou number the days that we fulfill,

Or the Times that we bring forth?

Canst thou send the lightnings to do thy will,

And cause them reign on earth?

Hast thou given a peacock goodly wings,

To please his foolishness?

Sit down at the heart of men and things,

Companion of the Press!


The Pope may launch his Interdict,

The Union its decree,

But the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked

By Us and such as We.

Remember the battle and stand aside

While Thrones and Powers confess

That King over all the children of pride

Is the Press--the Press--the Press!

Poem 402: The Pro-Consuls


The overfaithful sword returns the user

His heart's desire at price of his heart's blood.

The clamour of the arrogant accuser

Wastes that one hour we needed to make good.

This was foretold of old at our outgoing;

This we accepted who have squandered, knowing,

The strength and glory of our reputations,

At the day's need, as it were dross, to guard

The tender and new-dedicate foundations

Against the sea we fear -- not man's award.


They that dig foundations deep,

 Fit for realms to rise upon,

Little honour do they reap

 Of their generation,

Any more than mountains gain

Stature till we reach the plain.


With noveil before their face

 Such as shroud or sceptre lend --

Daily in the market-place,

 Of one height to foe and friend --

They must cheapen self to find

Ends uncheapened for mankind.


Through the night when hirelings rest,

 Sleepless they arise, alone,

The unsleeping arch to test

 And the o'er-trusted corner-stone,

'Gainst the need, they know, that lies

Hid behind the centuries.


Not by lust of praise or show

 Not by Peace herself betrayed --

Peace herself must they forego

 Till that peace be fitly made;

And in single strength uphold

Wearier hands and hearts acold.


On the stage their act hath framed

 For thy sports, O Liberty!

Doubted are they, and defamed

 By the tongues their act set free,

While they quicken, tend and raise

Power that must their power displace.


Lesser men feign greater goals,

 Failing whereof they may sit

Scholarly to judge the souls

 That go down into the pit,

And, despite its certain clay,

Heave a new world towards the day.


These at labour make no sign,

 More than planets, tides or years

Which discover God's design,

 Not our hopes and not our fears;

Nor in aught they gain or lose

Seek a triumph or excuse.


For, so the Ark be borne to Zion, who

Heeds how they perished or were paid that bore it?

For, so the Shrine abide, what shame -- what pride --

If we, the priests, were bound or crowned before it?

Poem 403: The Prodigal Son


Here come I to my own again,

Fed, forgiven and known again,

Claimed by bone of my bone again

And cheered by flesh of my flesh.

The fatted calf is dressed for me,

But the husks have greater zest for me,

I think my pigs will be best for me,

So I'm off to the Yards afresh.


I never was very refined, you see,

(And it weighs on my brother's mind, you see)

But there's no reproach among swine, d'you see,

For being a bit of a swine.

So I'm off with wallet and staff to eat

The bread that is three parts chaff to wheat,

But glory be! - there's a laugh to it,

Which isn't the case when we dine.


My father glooms and advises me,

My brother sulks and despises me,

And Mother catechises me

Till I want to go out and swear.

And, in spite of the butler's gravity,

I know that the servants have it I

Am a monster of moral depravity,

And I'm damned if I think it's fair!


I wasted my substance, I know I did,

On riotous living, so I did,

But there's nothing on record to show I did

Worse than my betters have done.

They talk of the money I spent out there -

They hint at the pace that I went out there -

But they all forget I was sent out there

Alone as a rich man's son.


So I was a mark for plunder at once,

And lost my cash (can you wonder?) at once,

But I didn't give up and knock under at once,

I worked in the Yards, for a spell,

Where I spent my nights and my days with hogs.

And shared their milk and maize with hogs,

Till, I guess, I have learned what pays with hogs

And - I have that knowledge to sell!


So back I go to my job again,

Not so easy to rob again,

Or quite so ready to sob again

On any neck that's around.

I'm leaving, Pater.  Good-bye to you!

God bless you, Mater! I'll write to you!

I wouldn't be impolite to you,

But, Brother, you are a hound!

The Celt in all his variants from Builth to Ballyhoo,

His mental processes are plain--one knows what he will do,

And can logically predicate his finish by his start;

But the English--ah, the English!--they are quite a race apart.


Their psychology is bovine, their outlook crude and raw.

They abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw;

But the straw that they were tickled with-the chaff that they were fed with--

They convert into a weaver's beam to break their foeman's head with.


For undemocratic reasons and for motives not of  State,

They  arrive  at  their  conclusions--largely  inarticulate.

Being void of self-expression they confide their views to none;

But sometimes in a smoking-room,  one learns why things were done.


Yes, sometimes in a smoking-room, through clouds of "Ers" an "Ums,"

Obliquely  and by inference,  illumination  comes,

On some step that they have taken, or some action they approve

Embellished with the argot of the Upper Fourth Remove.


In telegraphic sentences  half nodded to their friends,

They hint a matter's inwardness--and there the matter ends.

And while the Celt is talking from Valencia to Kirkwall,

The English--ah, the English!--don't say anything at all.

 Vowed to one sacrifice,

And not, as I hold them, battle-blind,

 But dying with open eyes?


That they did not ask me to draw the sword

 When they stood to endure their lot --

That they only looked to me for a word,

 And I answered I knew them not?


If it be found, when the battle clears,

 Their death has set me free,

Then how shall I live with myself through the years

Which they have bought for me?

 Which thou hast left behind.


Let nothing linger after--

 No whimpering ghost remain,

In wall, or beam, or rafter,

 Of any hate or pain.

Cleans and call home thy spirit,

 Deny her leave to cast,

On aught thy heirs inherit,

 The shadow of her past.

 What road our griefs may take;

Whose brain reflect our madness,

 Or whom our terrors shake:

For think, lest any languish

 By cause of thy distress--

The arrows of our anguish

 Fly farther than we guess.


Our lives, our tears, as water,

 Are spilled upon the ground;

 Yet God a means hath found,

Though Faith and Hope have vanished,

 And even Love grows dim--

A means whereby His banished

 Be not expelled from Him!

At Runnymede, At Runnymede,

  What say the reeds at Runnymede?

The lissom reeds that give and take,

That bend so far, but never break,

They keep the sleepy Thames awake

  With tales of John at Runnymede.


At Runnymede, at Runnymede,

  Oh, hear the reeds at Runnymede:--

"You mustn't sell, delay, deny,

A freeman's right or liberty.

It makes the stubborn Englishry,

  We saw 'em roused at Runnymede!


"When through our ranks the Barons came,

  With little thought of praise or blame,

But resolute to pay a game,

They lumbered up to Runnymede;

And there they launched in solid time

The first attack on Right Divine--

The curt, uncompromising 'Sign!'

  That settled John at Runnymede.


"At Runnymede, at Runnymede,

Your rights were won at Runnymede!

No freeman shall be fined or bound,

  Or dispossessed or freehold ground,

Except by lawful judgment found

And passed upon him by his peers.

Forget not, after all these years,

  The Charter Signed at Runnymede."


And still when Mob or Monarch lays

Too rude hand on English ways,

The whisper wakes, the shudder plays,

  Across the reeds at Runnymede.

And Tames, that knows the moods of kings,

And crowds and priests and suchlike things,

Rolls deep and dreadful as he brings

  Their warning down from Runnymede!

Poem 412: The Reformers


Not in the camp his victory lies

 Or triumph in the market-place,

Who is his Nation's sacrifice

To turn the judgement from his race.


Happy is he who, bred and taught

 By sleek, sufficing Circumstance --

Whose Gospel was the apparelled thought,

 Whose Gods were Luxury and Chance --


Seese, on the threshold of his days,

 The old life shrivel like a scroll,

And to unheralded dismays

 Submits his body and his soul;


The fatted shows wherein he stood

 Foregoing, and the idiot pride,

That he may prove with his own blood

 All that his easy sires denied --


Ultimate issues, primal springs,

 Demands, abasements, penalties --

The imperishable plinth of things

 Seen and unseen, that touch our peace.


For, though ensnaring ritual dim

 His vision through the after-years,

Yet virtue shall go out of him --

Example profiting his peers.


With great things charged he shall not hold

 Aloof till great occasion rise,

But serve, full-harnessed, as of old,

 The Days that are the Destinies.


He shall forswear and put away

 The idols of his sheltered house;

And to Necessity shall pay

 Unflinching tribute of his vows.


He shall not plead another's act,

 Nor bind him in another's oath

To weigh the Word above the Fact,

 Or make or take excuse for sloth.


The yoke he bore shall press him still,

 And, long-ingrained effort goad

To find, to fashion, and fulfil

 The cleaner life, the sterner code.


Not in the camp his victory lies --

 The world (unheeding his return)

Shall see it in his children's eyes

 And from his grandson's lips shall learn!

Poem 413: The Return


Peace is declared, and I return

To 'Ackneystadt, but not the same;

Things 'ave transpired which made me learn

The size and meanin' of the game.

I did no more than others did,

I don't know where the change began;

I started as a average kid,

I finished as a thinkin' man.


If England was what England seems

An' not the England of our dreams,

But only putty, brass, an' paint,

'Ow quick we'd drop 'er! But she ain't!


Before my gappin' mouth could speak

I 'eard it in my comrade's tone;

I saw it on my neighbour's cheek

Before I felt it flush my own.

An' last it come to me--not pride,

Nor yet conceit, but on the 'ole

(If such a term may be applied),

The makin's of a bloomin' soul.


Rivers at night that cluck an' jeer,

Plains which the moonshine turns to sea,

Mountains that never let you near,

An' stars to all eternity;

An' the quick-breathin' dark that fills

The 'ollows of the wilderness,

When the wind worries through the 'ills--

These may 'ave taught me more or less.


Towns without people, ten times took,

An' ten times left an' burned at last;

An' starvin' dogs that come to look

For owners when a column passed;

An' quiet, 'omesick talks between

Men, met by night, you never knew

Until--'is face--by shellfire seen--

Once--an' struck off. They taught me, too.


The day's lay-out--the mornin' sun

Beneath your 'at-brim as you sight;

The dinner-'ush from noon till one,

An' the full roar that lasts till night;

An' the pore dead that look so old

An' was so young an hour ago,

An' legs tied down before they're cold--

These are the things which make you know.


Also Time runnin' into years--

A thousand Places left be'ind--

An' Men from both two 'emispheres

Discussin' things of every kind;

So much more near than I 'ad known,

So much more great than I 'ad guessed--

An' me, like all the rest, alone--

But reachin' out to all the rest!


So 'ath it come to me--not pride,

Nor yet conceit, but on the 'ole

(If such a term may be applied),

The makin's of a bloomin' soul.

But now, discharged, I fall away

To do with little things again....

Gawd, 'oo knows all I cannot say,

Look after me in Thamesfontein!


If England was what England seems

An' not the England of our dreams,

But only putty, brass, an' paint,

'Ow quick we'd chuck 'er! But she ain't!

Poem 414: The Return of the Children


Neither the harps nor the crowns amused, nor the cherubs' dove-winged races--

Holding hands forlornly the Children wandered beneath the Dome,

Plucking the splendid robes  of the  passers-by,  and with pitiful! faces

Begging what Princes and Powers refused:--"Ah, please will you let us go home?"


Over the jewelled floor, nigh weeping, ran to them Mary the Mother,

Kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses, and drew them along to the gateway--

Yea, the all-iron unbribeable Door which Peter must guard and none other.

Straightway She took the Keys from his keeping, and opened and freed them straightway.


Then, to Her Son, Who had seen and smiled,  She said:  "On the night that I bore Thee,  

What didst Thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my arm?

Didst Thou push from the nipple, O Child,  to hear the angels adore Thee

When we two lay in the breath of the kine?" And He said -- "Thou hast done no harm."


So through the Void the Children ran homeward merrily hand in hand,

Looking neither to left nor right where the breathless Heavens stood still.

And the Guards of the Void resheathed their swords, for they heard the Command:

"Shall I that have suffered the Children to come to Me hold them against their will?"

Poem 415: The Rhyme Of The Three Captains


. . . At the close of a winter day,

Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay;

And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye,

And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby,

And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall,

And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all.

Their good guns guarded their great gray sides

 that were thirty foot in the sheer,

When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer.

Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze,

Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas.

Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,

And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.

"I ha' paid Port dues for your Law," quoth he, "and where is the Law ye boast

If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast?

Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk,

We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk;

I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare

Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre.

There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,

And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore.

He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black,

But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack.

He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan;

But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own.

He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line,

He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;

He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas,

He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?

My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats;

He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats.

I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,

But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied.

Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm,

I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm;

I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw,

And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw;

I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark,

I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark;

I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil,

And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil;

I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side,

 and tasselled his beard i' the mesh,

And spitted his crew on the live bamboo

 that grows through the gangrened flesh;

I had hove him down by the mangroves brown,

 where the mud-reef sucks and draws,

Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!

He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow,

For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!"

The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold,

And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold,

And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt: --

"Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut.

Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus:

He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us.

We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair,

And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre.

And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you,

We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true."

The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- "And what is that to me?

Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three?

Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line?

He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine.

There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in,

But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin.

Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel?

Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers?

 'Fore Gad, then, why does he steal?"

The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet,

For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet.

But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: --

"We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman."

The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: --

"'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!"

By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: --

"We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair."

The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: --

"They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm."

The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad,

The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord.

Masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft;

The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed: --

"It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again --

Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain.

It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea,

 and the swing of the unbought brine --

We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line:

Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer,

Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer;

Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty,

Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea.

Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack,

We are paid in the coin of the white man's trade --

 the bezant is hard, ay, and black.

The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut

How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port;

How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there

Shall dip their flag to a slaver's rag -- to show that his trade is fair!"

Poem 416: The Rhyme Of The Three Sealers


Away by the lands of the Japanee

     Where the paper lanterns glow

    And the crews of all the shipping drink

     In the house of Blood Street Joe,

    At twilight, when the landward breeze

     Brings up the harbour noise,

    And ebb of Yokohama Bay

     Swigs chattering through the buoys,

    In Cisco's Dewdrop Dining-Rooms

     They tell the tale anew

    Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight,

    When the ~Baltic~ ran from the ~Northern Light~

     And the ~Stralsund~ fought the two.


Now this is the Law of the Muscovite, that he proves with shot and steel,

When ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the seal,

Where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weed-hung shelves,

And the little blue fox he is bred for his skin

 and the seal they breed for themselves;

For when the ~matkas~ seek the shore to drop their pups aland,

The great man-seal haul out of the sea, a-roaring, band by band;

And when the first September gales have slaked their rutting-wrath,

The great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path.

Then dark they lie and stark they lie -- rookery, dune, and floe,

And the Northern Lights come down o' nights to dance with the houseless snow;

And God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe,

He hears the cry of the little kit-fox and the wind along the snow.

But since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear,

The sealing-boats they filch that way at hazard year by year.

English they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bear's flank,

And some be Scot, but the worst of the lot, and the boldest thieves, be Yank!


It was the sealer ~Northern Light~, to the Smoky Seas she bore,

With a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her fore.

(~Baltic~, ~Stralsund~, and ~Northern Light~ --

 oh! they were birds of a feather --

Slipping away to the Smoky Seas, three seal-thieves together!)

And at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay therein,

But her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin.

There were fifteen hundred skins abeach, cool pelt and proper fur,

When the ~Northern Light~ drove into the bight

 and the sea-mist drove with her.

The ~Baltic~ called her men and weighed -- she could not choose but run --

For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist, it shows like a four-inch gun.

(And loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship

And lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slip.)

She turned and dived in the sea-smother as a rabbit dives in the whins,

And the ~Northern Light~ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins.

They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear,

When they were aware of a sloop-of-war, ghost-white and very near.

Her flag she showed, and her guns she showed -- three of them, black, abeam,

And a funnel white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam.


There was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,

And the ~Northern Light~ stood out again, goose-winged to open sea.

(For life it is that is worse than death, by force of Russian law

To work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw.)

They had not run a mile from shore -- they heard no shots behind --

When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind:

"Bluffed -- raised out on a bluff," said he, "for if my name's Tom Hall,

You must set a thief to catch a thief -- and a thief has caught us all!

By every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine,

The hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine!

He has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar,

 and, faith, he has faked her well --

But I'd know the ~Stralsund~'s deckhouse yet from here to the booms o' Hell.

Oh, once we ha' met at Baltimore, and twice on Boston pier,

But the sickest day for you, Reuben Paine, was the day that you came here --

The day that you came here, my lad, to scare us from our seal

With your funnel made o' your painted cloth, and your guns o' rotten deal!

Ring and blow for the ~Baltic~ now, and head her back to the bay,

And we'll come into the game again -- with a double deck to play!"


They rang and blew the sealers' call -- the poaching cry of the sea --

And they raised the ~Baltic~ out of the mist, and an angry ship was she:

And blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again,

Till they heard the creak of the ~Stralsund~'s boom

 and the clank of her mooring chain.

They laid them down by bitt and boat, their pistols in their belts,

And:  "Will you fight for it, Reuben Paine, or will you share the pelts?"


A dog-toothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine, and bared his flenching-knife.

"Yea, skin for skin, and all that he hath a man will give for his life;

But I've six thousand skins below, and Yeddo Port to see,

And there's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three:

So go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill,

And I'll be good to your seal this catch, as many as I shall kill!"


Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid,

But the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did.

The weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak,

And the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke.

The bullets bit on bend and butt, the splinter slivered free

(Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!),

The thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,

But three were down on the ~Baltic~'s deck and two of the ~Stralsund~'s crew.

An arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound,

But, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound.

For one cried out on the Name of God, and one to have him cease,

And the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace;

And one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgin's Name,

And the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came.

And in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath,

And each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth --

Trigger and ear and eye acock, knit brow and hard-drawn lips --

Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships.

Till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath,

Till they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death:


"The tides they'll go through Fundy Race but I'll go nevermore

And see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore.

No more I'll see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground,

Or watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound.

Sorrow is me, in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall,

But if there's law o' God or man you'll swing for it yet, Tom Hall!"

Tom Hall stood up by the quarter-rail.  "Your words in your teeth," said he.

"There's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three.

So go in grace with Him to face, and an ill-spent life behind,

And I'll be good to your widows, Rube, as many as I shall find."


A ~Stralsund~ man shot blind and large, and a war-lock Finn was he,

And he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee.

Tom Hall caught hold by the topping-lift, and sat him down with an oath,

"You'll wait a little, Rube," he said, "the Devil has called for both.

The Devil is driving both this tide, and the killing-grounds are close,

And we'll go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes.

O men, put back your guns again and lay your rifles by,

We've fought our fight, and the best are down.  Let up and let us die!

Quit firing, by the bow there -- quit!  Call off the ~Baltic~'s crew!

You're sure of Hell as me or Rube -- but wait till we get through."

There went no word between the ships, but thick and quick and loud

The life-blood drummed on the dripping decks,

 with the fog-dew from the shroud,

The sea-pull drew them side by side, gunnel to gunnel laid,

And they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear, but never a word was said.


Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed:

"Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last?

Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind --

I have gotten my death where I got my bread, but I dare not face it blind.

Curse on the fog!  Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew

To clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?"

The good fog heard -- like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore,

And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore.

Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide,

And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside.

O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread,

And gold, raw gold, the spent shell rolled between the careless dead --

The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee,

And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see.


And a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift,

But no man stood by wheel or sheet, and they let the schooners drift.

And the rattle rose in Reuben's throat and he cast his soul with a cry,

And "Gone already?" Tom Hall he said.  "Then it's time for me to die."

His eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land,

And he spoke as a man that talks in dreams, his wound beneath his hand.

"Oh, there comes no good o' the westering wind that backs against the sun;

Wash down the decks -- they're all too red -- and share the skins and run,

~Baltic~, ~Stralsund~, and ~Northern Light~ -- clean share and share for all,

You'll find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees, but you will not find Tom Hall.

Evil he did in shoal-water and blacker sin on the deep,

But now he's sick of watch and trick and now he'll turn and sleep.

He'll have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so,

But he'll lie down on the killing-grounds where the holluschickie go.

And west you'll sail and south again, beyond the sea-fog's rim,

And tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him.

And you'll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside,

But carry him up to the sand-hollows to die as Bering died,

And make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fair,

And leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there!"


    Half-steam ahead by guess and lead, for the sun is mostly veiled --

    Through fog to fog, by luck and log, sail ye as Bering sailed;

    And if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain,

    North and by west, from Zapne Crest, ye raise the Crosses Twain.

    Fair marks are they to the inner bay, the reckless poacher knows

    What time the scarred see-catchie lead their sleek seraglios.

    Ever they hear the floe-pack clear, and the blast of the old bull-whale,

    And the deep seal-roar that beats off-shore above the loudest gale.

    Ever they wait the winter's hate as the thundering ~boorga~ calls,

    Where northward look they to St. George, and westward to St. Paul's.

    Ever they greet the hunted fleet -- lone keels off headlands drear --

    When the sealing-schooners flit that way at hazard year by year.

    Ever in Yokohama port men tell the tale anew

     Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight,

     When the ~Baltic~ ran from the ~Northern Light~

    And the ~Stralsund~ fought the two.

Poem 417: The River's Tale


Twenty bridges from Tower to Kew--

(Twenty bridges or twenty-two)--

Wanted to know what the River knew,

For they were young, and the Thames was old

And this is the tale that River told:--


"I walk my beat before London Town,

Five hours up and seven down.

Up I go till I end my run

At Tide-end-town, which is Teddington.

Down I come with the mud in my hands

And plaster it over the Maplin Sands.

But I'd have you know that these waters of mine

Were once a branch of the River Rhine,

When hundreds of miles to the East I went

And England was joined to the Continent.


"I remember the bat-winged lizard-birds,

The Age of Ice and the mammoth herds,

And the giant tigers that stalked them down

Through Regent's Park into Camden Town.

And I remember like yesterday

The earliest Cockney who came my way,

When he pushed through the forest that lined the Strand,

With paint on his face and a club in his hand.

He was death to feather and fin and fur.

He trapped my beavers at Westminster.

He netted my salmon, he hunted my deer,

He killed my heron off Lambeth Pier.

He fought his neighbour with axes and swords,

Flint or bronze, at my upper fords,

While down at Greenwich, for slaves and tin,

The tall Phoenician ships stole in,

And North Sea war-boats, painted and gay,

Flashed like dragon-flies, Erith way;

And Norseman and Negro and Gaul and Greek

Drank with the Britons in Barking Creek,

And life was gay, and the world was new,

And I was a mile across at Kew!

But the Roman came with a heavy hand,

And bridged and roaded and ruled the land,

And the Roman left and the Danes blew in--

And that's where your history-books begin!"

Poem 418: The Roman Centurion's Song


Legate, I had the news last night --my cohort ordered home

By ships to Portus Itius and thence by road to Rome.

I've marched the companies aboard, the arms are stowed below:

Now let another take my sword. Command me not to go!


I've served in Britain forty years, from Vectis to the Wall,

I have none other home than this, nor any life at all.

Last night I did not understand, but, now the hour draws near

That calls me to my native land, I feel that land is here.


Here where men say my name was made, here where my work was done;

Here where my dearest dead are laid--my wife--my wife and son;

Here where time, custom, grief and toil, age, memory, service, love,

Have rooted me in British soil. Ah, how can I remove?


For me this land, that sea, these airs, those folk and fields surffice.

What purple Southern pomp can match our changeful Northern skies,

Black with December snows unshed or pearled with August haze--

The clanging arch of steel-grey March, or June's long-lighted days?


You'll follow widening Rhodanus till vine an olive lean

Aslant before the sunny breeze that sweeps Nemausus clean

To Arelate's triple gate; but let me linger on,

Here where our stiff-necked British oaks confront Euroclydon!


You'll take the old Aurelian Road through shore-descending pines

Where, blue as any peacock's neck, the Tyrrhene Ocean shines.

You'll go where laurel crowns are won, but--will you e'er forget

The scent of hawthorn in the sun, or bracken in the wet?


Let me work here for Britain's sake--at any task you will--

A marsh to drain, a road to make or native troops to drill.

Some Western camp (I know the Pict) or granite Border keep,

Mid seas of heather derelict, where our old messmates sleep.


Legate, I come to you in tears--My cohort ordered home!

I've served in Britain forty years. What should I do in Rome?

Here is my heart, my soul, my mind--the only life I know.

I cannot leave it all behind. Command me not to go!

It was not in the open fight

Poem 420: The Rowers


The banked oars fell an hundred strong,

 And backed and threshed and ground,

But bitter was the rowers' song

 As they brought the war-boat round.


They had no heart for the rally and roar

 That makes the whale-bath smoke --

When the great blades cleave and hold and leave

  As one on the racing stroke.


They sang:--What reckoning do you keep,

 And steer by what star,

If we come unscathed from the Southern deep

 To be wrecked on a Baltic bar?


"Last night you swore our voyage was done,

  But seaward still we go.

And you tell us now of a secret vow

 You have made with an open foe!        


"That we must lie off a lightless coast

   And houl and back and veer

At the will of the breed that have wrought us most

   For a year and a year and a year!


"There was never a shame in Christendie

   They laid not to our door--

And you say we must take the winter sea

 And sail with them once more?


"Look South! The gale is scarce o'erpast

  That stripped and laid us down,

When we stood forth but they stood fast

 And prayed to see us drown.


"Our dead they mocked are scarcely cold,

  Our wounds are bleeding yet--

And you tell us now that our strength is sold

 To help them press for a debt!


"'Neath all the flags of all mankind

 That use upon the seas,

Was there no other fleet to find

 That you strike bands with these?


"Of evil times that men can choose

 On evil fate to fall,

What brooding Judgment let you loose

  To pick the worst of all?


"In sight of peace--from the Narrow Seas

   O'er half the world to run--

With a cheated crew, to league anew

   With the Goth and the shameless Hun!"

Poem 421: The Run of the Downs


The Weald is good, the Downs are best---

I'll give you the run of 'em, East to West.

Beachy Head and Winddoor Hill,

They were once and they are still.

Firle  Mount Caburn and Mount Harry

Go back as far as sums 'll carry.

Ditchling Beacon and Chanctonbury Ring

They have looked on many a thing,

And what those two have missed between 'em

I reckon Truleigh Hill has seen 'em.

Highden, Bignor and Duncton Down

Knew Old England before the Crown.

Linch Down, Treyford and Sunwood

Knew Old England before the Flood;

And when you end on the Hampshire side--

Butser's old as Time and Tide.

The Downs are sheep, the Weald is corn,

You be glad you are Sussex born!

Poem 422: The Runes of Weland's Sword


A smith makes me

To betray my Man

In my first fight.


To gather Gold

At the world's end

I am sent.


The Gold I gather

Comes into England

Out of deep Water.


Like a shining Fish

Then it descends

Into deep Water.


It is not given

For goods or gear,

But for The Thing.


The Gold I gather

A King covets

For an ill use


The Gold I gather

Is drawn up

Out of deep Water.


Like a shining Fish

Then it descends

Into deep Water.


It is not given

For goods or gear,

But for The Thing.

Poem 423: The Rupaiyat of Omar Kal'vin


Allowing for the difference 'twixt prose and rhymed exaggeration, this ought to reproduce the sense of what Sir A-- told the nation sometime ago, when the Government struck from our incomes two per cent.



Now the New Year, reviving last Year's Debt,

The Thoughtful Fisher casteth wide his Net;

 So I with begging Dish and ready Tongue

Assail all Men for all that I can get.


Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues --

Lo! Salt a Lever that I dare not use,

 Nor may I ask the Tillers in Bengal --

Surely my Kith and Kin will not refuse!


Pay -- and I promise by the Dust of Spring,

Retrenchment. If my promises can bring

 Comfort, Ye have Them now a thousandfold --

By Allah! I will promise Anything!


Indeed, indeed, Retrenchment oft before

I swore -- but did I mean it when I swore?

 And then, and then, We wandered to the Hills,

And so the Little Less became Much More.


Whether a Boileaugunge or Babylon,

I know not how the wretched Thing is done,

 The Items of Receipt grow surely small;

The Items of Expense mount one by one.


I cannot help it. What have I to do

With One and Five, or Four, or Three, or Two?

 Let Scribes spit Blood and Sulphur as they please,

Or Statesmen call me foolish -- Heed not you.


Behold, I promise -- Anything You will.

Behold, I greet you with an empty Till --

 Ah! Fellow-Sinners, of your Charity

Seek not the Reason of the Dearth, but fill.


For if I sinned and fell, where lies the Gain

Of Knowledge? Would it ease you of your Pain

 To know the tangled Threads of Revenue,

I ravel deeper in a hopeless Skein?


"Who hath not Prudence" -- what was it I said,

Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head,

 And gibes and mocks and People in the Street,

And fawns upon them for Her thriftless Bread?


Accursed is She of Eve's daughters -- She

Hath cast off Prudence, and Her End shall be

 Destruction . . . Brethren, of your Bounty

Some portion of your daily Bread to Me.

Poem 424: The Sacrifice Of Er-Heb


Er-Heb beyond the Hills of Ao-Safai

    Bears witness to the truth, and Ao-Safai

    Hath told the men of Gorukh.  Thence the tale

    Comes westward o'er the peaks to India.


The story of Bisesa, Armod's child, --

A maiden plighted to the Chief in War,

The Man of Sixty Spears, who held the Pass

That leads to Thibet, but to-day is gone

To seek his comfort of the God called Budh

The Silent -- showing how the Sickness ceased

Because of her who died to save the tribe.


Taman is One and greater than us all,

Taman is One and greater than all Gods:

Taman is Two in One and rides the sky,

Curved like a stallion's croup, from dusk to dawn,

And drums upon it with his heels, whereby

Is bred the neighing thunder in the hills.


This is Taman, the God of all Er-Heb,

Who was before all Gods, and made all Gods,

And presently will break the Gods he made,

And step upon the Earth to govern men

Who give him milk-dry ewes and cheat his Priests,

Or leave his shrine unlighted -- as Er-Heb

Left it unlighted and forgot Taman,

When all the Valley followed after Kysh

And Yabosh, little Gods but very wise,

And from the sky Taman beheld their sin.


He sent the Sickness out upon the hills,

The Red Horse Sickness with the iron hooves,

To turn the Valley to Taman again.


And the Red Horse snuffed thrice into the wind,

The naked wind that had no fear of him;

And the Red Horse stamped thrice upon the snow,

The naked snow that had no fear of him;

And the Red Horse went out across the rocks,

The ringing rocks that had no fear of him;

And downward, where the lean birch meets the snow,

And downward, where the gray pine meets the birch,

And downward, where the dwarf oak meets the pine,

Till at his feet our cup-like pastures lay.


That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,

Dropped as a cloth upon a dead man's face,

And weltered in the Valley, bluish-white

Like water very silent -- spread abroad,

Like water very silent, from the Shrine

Unlighted of Taman to where the stream

Is dammed to fill our cattle-troughs -- sent up

White waves that rocked and heaved and then were still,

Till all the Valley glittered like a marsh,

Beneath the moonlight, filled with sluggish mist

Knee-deep, so that men waded as they walked.


That night, the Red Horse grazed above the Dam,

Beyond the cattle-troughs.  Men heard him feed,

And those that heard him sickened where they lay.


Thus came the Sickness to Er-Heb, and slew

Ten men, strong men, and of the women four;

And the Red Horse went hillward with the dawn,

But near the cattle-troughs his hoof-prints lay.


That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,

Dropped as a cloth upon the dead, but rose

A little higher, to a young girl's height;

Till all the Valley glittered like a lake,

Beneath the moonlight, filled with sluggish mist.


That night, the Red Horse grazed beyond the Dam,

A stone's-throw from the troughs.  Men heard him feed,

And those that heard him sickened where they lay.

Thus came the Sickness to Er-Heb, and slew

Of men a score, and of the women eight,

And of the children two.


                         Because the road

To Gorukh was a road of enemies,

And Ao-Safai was blocked with early snow,

We could not flee from out the Valley.  Death

Smote at us in a slaughter-pen, and Kysh

Was mute as Yabosh, though the goats were slain;

And the Red Horse grazed nightly by the stream,

And later, outward, towards the Unlighted Shrine,

And those that heard him sickened where they lay.


Then said Bisesa to the Priests at dusk,

When the white mist rose up breast-high, and choked

The voices in the houses of the dead: --

"Yabosh and Kysh avail not.  If the Horse

Reach the Unlighted Shrine we surely die.

Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief,

Taman!"  Here rolled the thunder through the Hills

And Yabosh shook upon his pedestal.

"Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief

Too long."  And all were dumb save one, who cried

On Yabosh with the Sapphire 'twixt His knees,

But found no answer in the smoky roof,

And, being smitten of the Sickness, died

Before the altar of the Sapphire Shrine.


Then said Bisesa: -- "I am near to Death,

And have the Wisdom of the Grave for gift

To bear me on the path my feet must tread.

If there be wealth on earth, then I am rich,

For Armod is the first of all Er-Heb;

If there be beauty on the earth," -- her eyes

Dropped for a moment to the temple floor, --

"Ye know that I am fair.  If there be love,

Ye know that love is mine."  The Chief in War,

The Man of Sixty Spears, broke from the press,

And would have clasped her, but the Priests withstood,

Saying: -- "She has a message from Taman."

Then said Bisesa: -- "By my wealth and love

And beauty, I am chosen of the God

Taman."  Here rolled the thunder through the Hills

And Kysh fell forward on the Mound of Skulls.


In darkness, and before our Priests, the maid

Between the altars cast her bracelets down,

Therewith the heavy earrings Armod made,

When he was young, out of the water-gold

Of Gorukh -- threw the breast-plate thick with jade

Upon the turquoise anklets -- put aside

The bands of silver on her brow and neck;

And as the trinkets tinkled on the stones,

The thunder of Taman lowed like a bull.


Then said Bisesa, stretching out her hands,

As one in darkness fearing Devils: -- "Help!

O Priests, I am a woman very weak,

And who am I to know the will of Gods?

Taman hath called me -- whither shall I go?"

The Chief in War, the Man of Sixty Spears,

Howled in his torment, fettered by the Priests,

But dared not come to her to drag her forth,

And dared not lift his spear against the Priests.

Then all men wept.


                   There was a Priest of Kysh

Bent with a hundred winters, hairless, blind,

And taloned as the great Snow-Eagle is.

His seat was nearest to the altar-fires,

And he was counted dumb among the Priests.

But, whether Kysh decreed, or from Taman

The impotent tongue found utterance we know

As little as the bats beneath the eaves.

He cried so that they heard who stood without: --

"To the Unlighted Shrine!" and crept aside

Into the shadow of his fallen God

And whimpered, and Bisesa went her way.


That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,

Dropped as a cloth upon the dead, and rose

Above the roofs, and by the Unlighted Shrine

Lay as the slimy water of the troughs

When murrain thins the cattle of Er-Heb:

And through the mist men heard the Red Horse feed.


In Armod's house they burned Bisesa's dower,

And killed her black bull Tor, and broke her wheel,

And loosed her hair, as for the marriage-feast,

With cries more loud than mourning for the dead.


Across the fields, from Armod's dwelling-place,

We heard Bisesa weeping where she passed

To seek the Unlighted Shrine; the Red Horse neighed

And followed her, and on the river-mint

His hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears.


Out of the mists of evening, as the star

Of Ao-Safai climbs through the black snow-blur

To show the Pass is clear, Bisesa stepped

Upon the great gray slope of mortised stone,

The Causeway of Taman.  The Red Horse neighed

Behind her to the Unlighted Shrine -- then fled

North to the Mountain where his stable lies.


They know who dared the anger of Taman,

And watched that night above the clinging mists,

Far up the hill, Bisesa's passing in.


She set her hand upon the carven door,

Fouled by a myriad bats, and black with time,

Whereon is graved the Glory of Taman

In letters older than the Ao-Safai;

And twice she turned aside and twice she wept,

Cast down upon the threshold, clamouring

For him she loved -- the Man of Sixty Spears,

And for her father, -- and the black bull Tor,

Hers and her pride.  Yea, twice she turned away

Before the awful darkness of the door,

And the great horror of the Wall of Man

Where Man is made the plaything of Taman,

An Eyeless Face that waits above and laughs.


But the third time she cried and put her palms

Against the hewn stone leaves, and prayed Taman

To spare Er-Heb and take her life for price.


They know who watched, the doors were rent apart

And closed upon Bisesa, and the rain

Broke like a flood across the Valley, washed

The mist away; but louder than the rain

The thunder of Taman filled men with fear.


Some say that from the Unlighted Shrine she cried

For succour, very pitifully, thrice,

And others that she sang and had no fear.

And some that there was neither song nor cry,

But only thunder and the lashing rain.


Howbeit, in the morning men rose up,

Perplexed with horror, crowding to the Shrine.

And when Er-Heb was gathered at the doors

The Priests made lamentation and passed in

To a strange Temple and a God they feared

But knew not.


              From the crevices the grass

Had thrust the altar-slabs apart, the walls

Were gray with stains unclean, the roof-beams swelled

With many-coloured growth of rottenness,

And lichen veiled the Image of Taman

In leprosy.  The Basin of the Blood

Above the altar held the morning sun:

A winking ruby on its heart:  below,

Face hid in hands, the maid Bisesa lay.


    Er-Heb beyond the Hills of Ao-Safai

    Bears witness to the truth, and Ao-Safai

    Hath told the men of Gorukh.  Thence the tale

    Comes westward o'er the peaks to India.

Poem 425: The Sea and the Hills


Who hath desired the Sea? -- the sight of salt water unbounded --

The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?

The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing --

Stark calm on the lap of the Line or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing --

His Sea in no showing the same  his Sea and the same 'neath each showing:

          His Sea as she slackens or thrills?

So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills!


Who hath desired the Sea? -- the immense and contemptuous surges?

The shudder, the stumble, the swerve, as the star-stabbing bow-sprit emerges?

The orderly clouds of the Trades, the ridged, roaring sapphire thereunder --

Unheralded cliff-haunting flaws and the headsail's low-volleying thunder --

His Sea in no wonder the same  his Sea and the same through each wonder:

         His Sea as she rages or stills?

So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills.


Who hath desired the Sea? Her menaces swift as her mercies?

The in-rolling walls of the fog and the silver-winged breeze that disperses?

The unstable mined berg going South and the calvings and groans that declare it --

White water half-guessed overside and the moon breaking timely to bare it --

His Sea as his fathers have dared -- his Sea as his children shall dare it:

         His Sea as she serves him or kills?

So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills.


Who hath desired the Sea? Her excellent loneliness rather

Than forecourts of kings, and her outermost pits than the streets where men gather

Inland, among dust, under trees -- inland where the slayer may slay him --

Inland, out of reach of her arms, and the bosom whereon he must lay him

His Sea from the first that betrayed -- at the last that shall never betray him:

         His Sea that his being fulfils?

So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills.

Poem 426: The Sea-Wife


There dwells a wife by the Northern Gate,

And a wealthy wife is she;

She breeds a breed o' rovin' men

And casts them over sea.


And some are drowned in deep water,

And some in sight o' shore,

And word goes back to the weary wife

And ever she sends more.


For since that wife had gate or gear,

Or hearth or garth or bield,

She willed her sons to the white harvest,

And that is a bitter yield.


She wills her sons to the wet ploughing,

To ride the horse of tree,

And syne her sons come back again

Far-spent from out the sea.


The good wife's sons come home again

With little into their hands,

But the lore of men that ha' dealt with men

In the new and naked lands;


But the faith of men that ha' brothered men

By more than easy breath,

And the eyes o' men that ha' read wi' men

In the open books of death.


Rich are they, rich in wonders seen,

But poor in the goods o' men;

So what they ha' got by the skin o' their teeth

They sell for their teeth again.


For whether they lose to the naked life

Or win to their hearts' desire,

They tell it all to the weary wife

That nods beside the fire.


Her hearth is wide to every wind

That makes the white ash spin;

And tide and tide and 'tween the tides

Her sons go out and in;


(Out with great mirth that do desire

Hazard of trackless ways,

In with content to wait their watch

And warm before the blaze);


And some return by failing light,

And some in waking dream,

For she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts

That ride the rough roof-beam.


Home, they come home from all the ports,

The living and the dead;

The good wife's sons come home again

For her blessing on their head!

Poem 427: The Second Voyage


We've sent our little Cupids all ashore --

 They were frightened, they were tired, they were cold:

Our sails of silk and purple go to store,

 And we've cut away our mast of beaten gold

(Foul weather!)

Oh 'tis hemp and singing pine for to stand against the brine,

 But Love he is our master as of old!


The sea has shorn our galleries away,

 The salt has soiled our gilding past remede;

Our paint is flaked and blistered by the spray,

 Our sides are half a fathom furred in weed

(Foul weather!)

And the Doves of Venus fled and the petrels came instead,

 But Love he was our master at our need!


'Was Youth would keep no vigil at the bow,

 'Was Pleasure at the helm too drunk to steer --

We've shipped three able quartermasters now.

 Men call them Custom, Reverence, and Fear

(Foul weather!)

They are old and scarred and plain, but we'll run no risk again

 From any Port o' Paphos mutineer!


We seek no more the tempest for delight,

 We skirt no more the indraught and the shoal --

We ask no more of any day or night

 Than to come with least adventure to our goal

(Foul weather!)

What we find we needs must brook, but we do not go to look,

 Nor tempt the Lord our God that saved us whole.


Yet, caring so, not overmuch we care

 To brace and trim for every foolish blast,

If the squall be pleased to seep us unaware,

 He may bellow off to leeward like the last

(Foul weather!)

We will blame it on the deep (for the watch must have their sleep),

 And Love can come and wake us when 'tis past.


Oh launch them down with music from the beach,

 Oh warp them out with garlands from the quays --

Most resolute -- a damsel unto each --

 New prows that seek the old Hesperides!

(Foul weather!)

Though we know their voyage is vain, yet we see our path again

 In the saffroned bridesails scenting all the seas!

(Foul weather!)

Poem 428: The Secret of the Machinery


Modern Machinery

We were taken from the ore-bed and the mine,

 We were melted in the furnace and the pit--

We were cast and wrought and hammered to design,

 We were cut and filed and tooled and gauged to fit.

Some water, coal, and oil is all we ask,

 And a thousandth of an inch to give us play:

And now, if you will set us to our task,

 We will serve you four and twenty hours a day!


   We can pull and haul and push and lift and drive,

   We can print and plough and weave and heat and light,

   We can run and race and swim and fly and dive,

   We can see and hear and count and read and write!


Would you call a friend from half across the world?

  If you'll let us have his name and town and state,

You shall see and hear your cracking question hurled

 Across the arch of heaven while you wait.

Has he answered? Does he need you at his side-

You can start this very evening if you choose

And take the Western Ocean in the stride

 O seventy thousand horses and some screws!


   The boat-express is waiting your command!

   You will find the Mauritania at the quay,

   Till her captain turns the lever 'neath his hand,

   And the monstrous nine-decked city goes to sea.


Do you wish to make the mountains bare their head

 And lay their new-cut forests at your feet?

Do you want to turn a river in its bed,

 Or plant a barren wilderness with wheat?

Shall we pipe aloft and bring you water down

 From the never-failing cisterns of the snows,

To work the mills and tramways in your town,

 And irrigate your orchards as it flows?


   It is easy!  Give us dynamite and drills!

   Watch the iron-shouldered rocks lie down and quake,

   As the thirsty desert-level floods and fills,

   And the valley we have dammed becomes a lake.


But remember, please, the Law by which we live,

 We are not built to comprehend a lie,

We can neither love nor pity nor forgive.

 If you make a slip in handling us you die!

We are greater than the Peoples or the Kings-

 Be humble, as you crawl beneath our rods!--

Our touch can alter all created things,

  We are everything on earth--except The Gods!


   Though our smoke may hide the Heavens from your eyes,

   It will vanish and the stars will shine again,

   Because, for all our power and weight and size,

   We are nothing more than children of your brain!

Poem 430: The Settler


Here, where my fresh-turned furrows run,

            And the deep soil glistens red,

         I will repair the wrong that was done

            To the living and the dead.

         Here, where the senseless bullet fell,

            And the barren shrapnel burst,

         I will plant a tree, I will dig a well,

            Against the heat and the thirst.


         Here, in a large and a sunlit land,

           Where no wrong bites to the bone,

         I will lay my hand in my neighbour's hand,

           And together we will atone

         For the set folly and the red breach

            And the black waste of it all;

         Giving and taking counsel each

            Over the cattle-kraal.


         Here will we join against our foes--

            The hailstroke and the storm,

          And the red and rustling cloud that blows

            The locust's mile-deep swarm.

          Frost and murrain and floods let loose

             Shall launch us side by side

          In the holy wars that have no truce

              'Twixt seed and harvest-tide.


Earth, where we rode to slay or be slain,

  Our love shall redeem unto life.        

We will gather and lead to her lips again

  The waters of ancient strife,

From the far and fiercely guarded streams

  And the pools where we lay in wait,

Till the corn cover our evil dreams

 And the young corn our hate.


And when we bring old fights to mind,

 We will not remember the sin--

If there be blood on his head of my kind,

 Or blood on my head of his kin--

For the ungrazed upland, the untilled lea

 Cry, and the fields forlorn:

"The dead must bury their dead, but ye-

 Ye serve an host unborn."


Bless then, Our God, the new-yoked plough

 And the good beasts that draw,

And the bread we eat in the sweat of our brow

 According to Thy Law.

After us cometh a multitude--

 Prosper the work of our hands,

That we may feed with our land's food

 The folk of all our lands!


Here, in the waves and the troughs of the plains,

 Where the healing stillness lies,

And the vast, benignant sky restrains

 And the long days make wise--

Bless to our use the rain and the sun

 And the blind seed in its bed,

That we may repair the wrong that was done

 To the living and the dead!

Poem 432: The Shut-Eye Sentry


Sez the Junior Orderly Sergeant

To the Senior Orderly Man:

"Our Orderly Orf'cer's ~hokee-mut~,

You 'elp 'im all you can.

For the wine was old and the night is cold,

An' the best we may go wrong,

So, 'fore 'e gits to the sentry-box,

You pass the word along."


    So it was "Rounds!  What Rounds?" at two of a frosty night,

      'E's 'oldin' on by the sergeant's sash, but, sentry, shut your eye.

    An' it was "Pass!  All's well!"  Oh, ain't 'e drippin' tight!

      'E'll need an affidavit pretty badly by-an'-by.


The moon was white on the barricks,

The road was white an' wide,

An' the Orderly Orf'cer took it all,

An' the ten-foot ditch beside.

An' the corporal pulled an' the sergeant pushed,

An' the three they danced along,

But I'd shut my eyes in the sentry-box,

So I didn't see nothin' wrong.


    Though it was "Rounds!  What Rounds?"  O corporal, 'old 'im up!

      'E's usin' 'is cap as it shouldn't be used, but, sentry, shut your eye.

    An' it was "Pass!  All's well!"  Ho, shun the foamin' cup!

With 'is belt an' stock undone;

But we sluiced 'im down an' we washed 'im out,

An' a first-class job we made,

When we saved 'im, smart as a bombardier,

For six-o'clock parade.

      'E's usin' 'is sword for a bicycle, but, sentry, shut your eye.

    An' it was "Pass!  All's well!"  'E's called me "Darlin' Jane"!

      'E'll need, etc.


The drill was long an' 'eavy,

The sky was 'ot an' blue,

An' 'is eye was wild an' 'is 'air was wet,

But 'is sergeant pulled 'im through.

Our men was good old trusties --

They'd done it on their 'ead;

But you ought to 'ave 'eard 'em markin' time

To 'ide the things 'e said!


    For it was "Right flank -- wheel!" for "'Alt, an' stand at ease!"

      An' "Left extend!" for "Centre close!"  O marker, shut your eye!

    An' it was, "'Ere, sir, 'ere! before the Colonel sees!"

      So he needed affidavits pretty badly by-an'-by.


There was two-an'-thirty sergeants,

There was corp'rals forty-one,

There was just nine 'undred rank an' file

To swear to a touch o' sun.

There was me 'e'd kissed in the sentry-box,

As I 'ave not told in my song,

But I took my oath, which were Bible truth,

I 'adn't seen nothin' wrong.


There's them that's 'ot an' 'aughty,

There's them that's cold an' 'ard,

But there comes a night when the best gets tight,

And then turns out the Guard.

I've seen them 'ide their liquor

In every kind o' way,

But most depends on makin' friends

With Privit Thomas A.!


    When it is "Rounds!  What Rounds?"  'E's breathin' through 'is nose.

      'E's reelin', rollin', roarin' tight, but, sentry, shut your eye.

    An' it is "Pass!  All's well!"  An' that's the way it goes:

Poem 433: The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo


This is the mouth-filling song of the race that was run by a Boomer.

Run in a single burst--only event of its kind--

Started by Big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma,

Old Man Kangaroo first, Yellow-Dog Dingo behind.


Kangaroo bounded away, his back-legs working like pistons--

Bounded from morning till dark, twenty-five feet at a bound.

Yellow-Dog Dingo lay like a yellow cloud in the distance--

Much too busy  to bark. My! but they covered the ground!


Nobody knows where they  went, or followed the track that they flew in,

For that Continent hadn't been given a name.

They ran thirty degrees  from Torres Straits to Leeuwin

(Look at the Atlas, please  then they  ran back as they came.


S'posing you could trot from Adelaide to the Pacific

For an afternoon's run -- half what these gentlemen did--

You would feel rather hot, but your legs would develop terrific,

Yes, my importunate son, you'd be a Marvellous Kid!

Poem 434: The Song at Cock-Crow


The first time that Peter denied his Lord

 He shrank from the cudgel, the scourge and the cord,

But followed far off to see what they would do,

 Till the cock crew--till the cock crew--

After Gethsemane, till the cock crew!


The first time that Peter denied his Lord

 'Twas only a maid in the palace who heard,

As he sat by the fire and warmed himself through.

 Then the cock crew! Then the cock crew!

("Though also art one of them.") Then the cock crew!


The first time that Peter denied his Lord

 He had neither the Throne, nor the Keys nor the Sword--

A poor silly fisherman, what could he do,

 When the cock crew--when the cock crew--

But weep for his wickedness when the cock crew?


The next time that Peter denied his Lord

 He was Fisher of Men, as foretold by the Word,

With the Crown on his brow and the Cross on his shoe,

 When the cock crew--when the cock crew--

In Flanders and Picardy when the cock crew!


The next time that Peter denied his Lord

 'Twas Mary the Mother in Heaven Who heard,

She grieved for the maidens and wives that they slew

 When the cock crew--when the cock crew--

At Tirmonde and Aerschott when the cock crew!


The next time that Peter denied his Lord

The Babe in the Manger awakened and stirred,

And He stretched out His arms for the playmates

 He knew--

When the cock crew--when the cock crew--

But the waters had covered them when the cock crew!


The next time that Peter denied his Lord

 'Twas Earth in her agony waited his word,

But he sat by the fire and naught would he do,

 Though the cock crew--though the cock crew--

Over all Christendom, though the cock crew!


The last time that Peter denied his Lord,

 The Father took from him the Keys and the Sword,

And the Mother and Babe brake his Kingdom in two,

 When the cock crew--when the cock crew--

(Because of his wickedness) when the cock crew!

Poem 435: The Song of Diego Valdez


The God of Fair Beginnings

 Hath prospered here my hand --

The cargoes of my lading,

 And the keels of my command.

For out of many ventures

 That sailed with hope as high,

My own have made the better trade,

 And Admiral am I.


To me my King's much honour,

 To me my people's love --

To me the pride of Princes

 And power all pride above;

To me the shouting cities,

 To me the mob's refrain: --

"Who knows not noble Valdez

 "Hath never heard of Spain."


But I remember comrades --

 Old playmates on new seas --

When as we traded orpiment

 Among the savages --

A thousand leagues to south'ard

 And thirty years removed --

They knew nor noble Valdez,

 But me they knew and loved.


Then they that found good liquor,

 They drank it not alone,

And they that found fair plunder,

 They told us every one,

About our chosen islands

 Or secret shoals between,

When, weary from far voyage,

 We gathered to careen.

Were burned our breaming-fagots

 All pale along the shore:

There rose our worn pavilions --

 A sail above an oar:

As flashed each yeaming anchor

 Through mellow seas afire,

So swift our careless captains

 Rowed each to his desire.


Where lay our loosened harness?

 Where turned our naked feet?

Whose tavern 'mid the palm-trees?

 What quenchings of what heat?

Oh, fountain in the desert!

 Oh, cistern in the waste!

Oh, bread we ate in secret!

 Oh, cup we spilled in haste!


The youth new-taught of longing,

 The widow curbed and wan,

The goodwife proud at season,

 And the maid aware of man --

All souls unslaked, consuming,

 Defrauded in delays,

Desire not more their quittance

 Than I those forfeit days!


I dreamed to wait my pleasure

 Unchanged my spring would bide:

Wherefore, to wait my pleasure,

 I put my spring aside

Till, first in face of Fortune,

 And last in mazed disdain,

I made Diego Valdez

 High Admiral of Spain.


Then walked no wind 'neath Heaven

 Nor surge that did not aid --

I dared extreme occasion,

 Nor ever one betrayed.

They wrought a deeper treason --

 (Led seas that served my needs!)

They sold Diego Valdez

 To bondage of great deeds.


The tempest flung me seaward,

 And pinned and bade me hold

The course I might not alter --

And men esteemed me bold!

The calms embayed my quarry,

 The fog-wreath sealed his eyes;

The dawn-wind brought my topsails --

 And men esteemed me wise!


Yet, 'spite my tyrant triumphs,

 Bewildered, dispossessed --

My dream held I before me

 My vision of my rest;

But, crowned by Fleet and People,

 And bound by King and Pope --

Stands here Diego Valdez

 To rob me of my hope.


No prayer of mine shall move him.

 No word of his set free

The Lord of Sixty Pennants

 And the Steward of the Sea.

His will can loose ten thousand

 To seek their loves again --

But not Diego Valdez,

 High Admiral of Spain.


There walks no wind 'neath Heaven

  Nor wave that shall restore

The old careening riot

 And the clamorous, crowded shore --

The fountain in the desert,

 The cistern in the waste,

The bread we ate in secret,

 The cup we spilled in haste.


Now call I to my Captains --

 For council fly the sign --

Now leap their zealous galleys,

 Twelve-oared, across the brine.

To me the straiter prison,

 To me the heavier chain --

To me Diego Valdez,

 High Admiral of Spain!

Poem 436: The Song Of The Banjo


You couldn't pack a Broadwood half a mile --

You mustn't leave a fiddle in the damp --

You couldn't raft an organ up the Nile,

And play it in an Equatorial swamp.

~I~ travel with the cooking-pots and pails --

~I'm~ sandwiched 'tween the coffee and the pork --

And when the dusty column checks and tails,

You should hear me spur the rear-guard to a walk!

    With my "~Pilly-willy-winky-winky popp!~"

    [Oh, it's any tune that comes into my head!]

    So I keep 'em moving forward till they drop;

    So I play 'em up to water and to bed.


In the silence of the camp before the fight,

When it's good to make your will and say your prayer,

You can hear my ~strumpty-tumpty~ overnight

Explaining ten to one was always fair.

I'm the Prophet of the Utterly Absurd,

Of the Patently Impossible and Vain --

And when the Thing that Couldn't has occurred,

Give me time to change my leg and go again.

    With my "~Tumpa-tumpa-tumpa-tum-pa tump!~"

    In the desert where the dung-fed camp-smoke curled

    There was never voice before us till I led our lonely chorus,

    I -- the war-drum of the White Man round the world!


By the bitter road the Younger Son must tread,

Ere he win to hearth and saddle of his own, --

'Mid the riot of the shearers at the shed,

In the silence of the herder's hut alone --

In the twilight, on a bucket upside down,

Hear me babble what the weakest won't confess --

I am Memory and Torment -- I am Town!

I am all that ever went with evening dress!

    With my "~Tunk-a tunka-tunka-tunka-tunk!~"

    [So the lights -- the London Lights -- grow near and plain!]

    So I rowel 'em afresh towards the Devil and the Flesh,

    Till I bring my broken rankers home again.


In desire of many marvels over sea,

Where the new-raised tropic city sweats and roars,

I have sailed with Young Ulysses from the quay

Till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores.

He is blooded to the open and the sky,

He is taken in a snare that shall not fail,

He shall hear me singing strongly, till he die,

Like the shouting of a backstay in a gale.

    With my "~Hya!  Heeya!  Heeya!  Hullah!  Haul!~"

    [O the green that thunders aft along the deck!]

    Are you sick o' towns and men?  You must sign and sail again,

    For it's "Johnny Bowlegs, pack your kit and trek!"


Through the gorge that gives the stars at noon-day clear --

Up the pass that packs the scud beneath our wheel --

Round the bluff that sinks her thousand fathom sheer --

Down the valley with our guttering brakes asqueal:

Where the trestle groans and quivers in the snow,

Where the many-shedded levels loop and twine,

So I lead my reckless children from below

Till we sing the Song of Roland to the pine.

    With my "~Tinka-tinka-tinka-tinka-tink!~"

    [And the axe has cleared the mountain, croup and crest!]

    So we ride the iron stallions down to drink,

    Through the ca]~nons to the waters of the West!


And the tunes that mean so much to you alone --

Common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose,

Vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan --

I can rip your very heartstrings out with those;

With the feasting, and the folly, and the fun --

And the lying, and the lusting, and the drink,

And the merry play that drops you, when you're done,

To the thoughts that burn like irons if you think.

    With my "~Plunka-lunka-lunka-lunka-lunk!~"

    Here's a trifle on account of pleasure past,

    Ere the wit that made you win gives you eyes to see your sin

    And the heavier repentance at the last!


Let the organ moan her sorrow to the roof --

I have told the naked stars the Grief of Man!

Let the trumpets snare the foeman to the proof --

I have known Defeat, and mocked it as we ran!

My bray ye may not alter nor mistake

When I stand to jeer the fatted Soul of Things,

But the Song of Lost Endeavour that I make,

Is it hidden in the twanging of the strings?

    With my "~Ta-ra-rara-rara-ra-ra-rrrp!~"

    [Is it naught to you that hear and pass me by?]

    But the word -- the word is mine, when the order moves the line

    And the lean, locked ranks go roaring down to die.


Of the driven dust of speech I make a flame

And a scourge of broken withes that men let fall:

For the words that had no honour till I came --

Lo! I raise them into honour over all!

By the wisdom of the centuries I speak --

To the tune of yestermorn I set the truth --

I, the joy of life unquestioned -- I, the Greek --

I, the everlasting Wonder Song of Youth!

    With my "~Tinka-tinka-tinka-tinka-tink!~"

    [What d'ye lack, my noble masters?  What d'ye lack?]

    So I draw the world together link by link:

    Yea, from Delos up to Limerick and back!

Poem 438: The Song Of The Dead


Hear now the Song of the Dead -- in the North by the torn berg-edges --

    They that look still to the Pole, asleep by their hide-stripped sledges.

    Song of the Dead in the South -- in the sun by their skeleton horses,

    Where the warrigal whimpers and bays through the dust

      of the sear river-courses.


    Song of the Dead in the East -- in the heat-rotted jungle hollows,

    Where the dog-ape barks in the kloof --

      in the brake of the buffalo-wallows.

    Song of the Dead in the West --

      in the Barrens, the waste that betrayed them,

    Where the wolverene tumbles their packs

      from the camp and the grave-mound they made them;

                Hear now the Song of the Dead!



  I


We were dreamers, dreaming greatly, in the man-stifled town;

We yearned beyond the sky-line where the strange roads go down.

Came the Whisper, came the Vision, came the Power with the Need,

Till the Soul that is not man's soul was lent us to lead.

As the deer breaks -- as the steer breaks -- from the herd where they graze,

In the faith of little children we went on our ways.

Then the wood failed -- then the food failed -- then the last water dried --

In the faith of little children we lay down and died.

On the sand-drift -- on the veldt-side -- in the fern-scrub we lay,

That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way.

Follow after -- follow after!  We have watered the root,

And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit!

Follow after -- we are waiting, by the trails that we lost,

For the sounds of many footsteps, for the tread of a host.

Follow after -- follow after -- for the harvest is sown:

By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own!


    When Drake went down to the Horn

      And England was crowned thereby,

    'Twixt seas unsailed and shores unhailed

      Our Lodge -- our Lodge was born

      (And England was crowned thereby!)


    Which never shall close again

      By day nor yet by night,

    While man shall take his life to stake

      At risk of shoal or main

      (By day nor yet by night).


    But standeth even so

      As now we witness here,

    While men depart, of joyful heart,

      Adventure for to know

      (As now bear witness here!)

We have fed our sea for a thousand years

And she calls us, still unfed,

Though there's never a wave of all her waves

But marks our English dead:

We have strawed our best to the weed's unrest,

To the shark and the sheering gull.

If blood be the price of admiralty,

Lord God, we ha' paid in full!


There's never a flood goes shoreward now

But lifts a keel we manned;

There's never an ebb goes seaward now

But drops our dead on the sand --

But slinks our dead on the sands forlore,

From the Ducies to the Swin.

If blood be the price of admiralty,

If blood be the price of admiralty,

Lord God, we ha' paid it in!


We must feed our sea for a thousand years,

For that is our doom and pride,

As it was when they sailed with the ~Golden Hind~,

Or the wreck that struck last tide --

Or the wreck that lies on the spouting reef

Where the ghastly blue-lights flare.

If blood be the price of admiralty,

If blood be the price of admiralty,

If blood be the price of admiralty,

Lord God, we ha' bought it fair!

Deep in all dishonour though we stained our garments' hem.

Oh be ye not dismayed,

Though we stumbled and we strayed,

We were led by evil counsellors -- the Lord shall deal with them!


Hold ye the Faith -- the Faith our Fathers seal]ed us;

Whoring not with visions -- overwise and overstale.

Except ye pay the Lord

Single heart and single sword,

Of your children in their bondage shall He ask them treble-tale!


Keep ye the Law -- be swift in all obedience --

Clear the land of evil, drive the road and bridge the ford.

Make ye sure to each his own

By the peace among Our peoples let men know we serve the Lord!

Look, are we poor in the land?  Judge, are we men of The Blood?


Those that have stayed at thy knees, Mother, go call them in --

We that were bred overseas wait and would speak with our kin.

Not in the dark do we fight -- haggle and flout and gibe;

Selling our love for a price, loaning our hearts for a bribe.

Gifts have we only to-day -- Love without promise or fee --

Hear, for thy children speak, from the uttermost parts of the sea!

Poem 441: The Sons of Martha


The Sons of Mary seldom bother, for they have inherited that good part;

But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother of the careful soul and the troubled heart.

And because she lost her temper once, and because she was rude to the Lord her Guest,

Her Sons must wait upon Mary's Sons, world without end, reprieve, or rest.


It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock.

It is their care that the gear engages; it is their care that the switches lock.

It is their care that the wheels run truly; it is their care to embark and entrain,

Tally, transport, and deliver duly the Sons of Mary by land and main.


They say to mountains ``Be ye removèd.'' They say to the lesser floods ``Be dry.''

Under their rods are the rocks reprovèd---they are not afraid of that which is high.

Then do the hill-tops shake to the summit---then is the bed of the deep laid bare,

That the Sons of Mary may overcome it, pleasantly sleeping and unaware.


They finger Death at their gloves' end where they piece and repiece the living wires.

He rears against the gates they tend: they feed him hungry behind their fires.

Early at dawn, ere men see clear, they stumble into his terrible stall,

And hale him forth like a haltered steer, and goad and turn him till evenfall.


To these from birth is Belief forbidden; from these till death is Relief afar.

They are concerned with matters hidden---under the earthline their altars are---

The secret fountains to follow up, waters withdrawn to restore to the mouth,

And gather the floods as in a cup, and pour them again at a city's drouth.


They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the nuts work loose.

They do not preach that His Pity allows them to drop their job when they damn-well choose.

As in the thronged and the lighted ways, so in the dark and the desert they stand,

Wary and watchful all their days that their brethren's ways may be long in the land.


Raise ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more fair or flat;

Lo, it is black already with the blood some Son of Martha spilled for that!

Not as a ladder from earth to Heaven, not as a witness to any creed,

But simple service simply given to his own kind in their common need.


And the Sons of Mary smile and are blessèd---they know the Angels are on their side.

They know in them is the Grace confessèd, and for them are the Mercies multiplied.

They sit at the feet---they hear the Word---they see how truly the Promise runs.

They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and---the Lord He lays it on Martha's Sons!

Poem 443: The Story Of Ung


Once, on a glittering ice-field, ages and ages ago,

Ung, a maker of pictures, fashioned an image of snow.

Fashioned the form of a tribesman -- gaily he whistled and sung,

Working the snow with his fingers.  ~Read ye the Story of Ung!~


Pleased was his tribe with that image -- came in their hundreds to scan --

Handled it, smelt it, and grunted:  "Verily, this is a man!

Thus do we carry our lances -- thus is a war-belt slung.

Lo! it is even as we are.  Glory and honour to Ung!"


Later he pictured an aurochs -- later he pictured a bear --

Pictured the sabre-tooth tiger dragging a man to his lair --

Pictured the mountainous mammoth, hairy, abhorrent, alone --

Out of the love that he bore them, scribing them clearly on bone.


Swift came the tribe to behold them, peering and pushing and still --

Men of the berg-battered beaches, men of the boulder-hatched hill --

Hunters and fishers and trappers, presently whispering low:

"Yea, they are like -- and it may be --  But how does the Picture-man know?"


"Ung -- hath he slept with the Aurochs -- watched where the Mastodon roam?

Spoke on the ice with the Bow-head -- followed the Sabre-tooth home?

Nay!  These are toys of his fancy!  If he have cheated us so,

How is there truth in his image -- the man that he fashioned of snow?"


Wroth was that maker of pictures -- hotly he answered the call:

"Hunters and fishers and trappers, children and fools are ye all!

Look at the beasts when ye hunt them!"  Swift from the tumult he broke,

Ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke.


And the father of Ung gave answer, that was old and wise in the craft,

Maker of pictures aforetime, he leaned on his lance and laughed:

"If they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done,

And each man would make him a picture, and -- what would become of my son?


"There would be no pelts of the reindeer, flung down at thy cave for a gift,

Nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the Baltic drift;

No store of well-drilled needles, nor ouches of amber pale;

No new-cut tongues of the bison, nor meat of the stranded whale.


"~Thou~ hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze,

Nor worked the war-boats outward through the rush of the rock-staked seas,

Yet they bring thee fish and plunder -- full meal and an easy bed --

And all for the sake of thy pictures."  And Ung held down his head.


"~Thou~ hast not stood to the Aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight;

Men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright.

And the heart of the hairy Mammoth, thou sayest, they do not see,

Yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee.


"And now do they press to thy pictures, with opened mouth and eye,

And a little gift in the doorway, and the praise no gift can buy:

But -- sure they have doubted thy pictures, and that is a grievous stain --

Son that can see so clearly, return them their gifts again!"


And Ung looked down at his deerskins -- their broad shell-tasselled bands --

And Ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands;

And he gloved himself and departed, and he heard his father, behind:

"Son that can see so clearly, rejoice that thy tribe is blind!"


Straight on the glittering ice-field, by the caves of the lost Dordogne,

Ung, a maker of pictures, fell to his scribing on bone

Even to mammoth editions.  Gaily he whistled and sung,

Blessing his tribe for their blindness.  ~Heed ye the Story of Ung!~

Full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail.

It cost a watch to steer her, and a week to shorten sail;

But, spite all modern notions, I found her first and best --

The only certain packet for the Islands of the Blest.


Fair held the breeze behind us -- 'twas warm with lovers' prayers.

We'd stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs.

They shipped as Able Bastards till the Wicked Nurse confessed,

And they worked the old three-decker to the Islands of the Blest.


By ways no gaze could follow, a course unspoiled of Cook,

Per Fancy, fleetest in man, our titled berths we took

With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed,

And a Church of England parson for the Islands of the Blest.


We asked no social questions -- we pumped no hidden shame --

We never talked obstetrics when the Little Stranger came:

We left the Lord in Heaven, we left the fiends in Hell.

We weren't exactly Yussufs, but -- Zuleika didn't tell.


No moral doubt assailed us, so when the port we neared,

The villain had his flogging at the gangway, and we cheered.

'Twas fiddle in the forc's'le -- 'twas garlands on the mast,

For every one got married, and I went ashore at last.


I left 'em all in couples a-kissing on the decks.

I left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques.

In endless English comfort by county-folk caressed,

I left the old three-decker at the Islands of the Blest!


That route is barred to steamers:  you'll never lift again

Our purple-painted headlands or the lordly keeps of Spain.

They're just beyond your skyline, howe'er so far you cruise

In a ram-you-damn-you liner with a brace of bucking screws.


Swing round your aching search-light -- 'twill show no haven's peace.

Ay, blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf, gray-bearded seas!

Boom out the dripping oil-bags to skin the deep's unrest --

And you aren't one knot the nearer to the Islands of the Blest!


But when you're threshing, crippled, with broken bridge and rail,

At a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale,

Calm as the Flying Dutchman, from truck to taffrail dressed,

You'll see the old three-decker for the Islands of the Blest.


You'll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread;

You'll hear the long-drawn thunder 'neath her leaping figure-head;

While far, so far above you, her tall poop-lanterns shine

Unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine!


Hull down -- hull down and under -- she dwindles to a speck,

With noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck.

All's well -- all's well aboard her -- she's left you far behind,

With a scent of old-world roses through the fog that ties you blind.


Her crew are babes or madmen?  Her port is all to make?

You're manned by Truth and Science, and you steam for steaming's sake?

Well, tinker up your engines -- you know your business best --

~She~'s taking tired people to the Islands of the Blest!

Poem 446: The Undertaker's Horse..


The eldest son bestrides him,

And the pretty daughter rides him,

And I meet him oft o' mornings on the Course;

And there kindles in my bosom

An emotion chill and gruesome

As I canter past the Undertaker's Horse.


Neither shies he nor is restive,

But a hideously suggestive

Trot, professional and placid, he affects;

And the cadence of his hoof-beats

To my mind this grim reproof beats: --

"Mend your pace, my friend, I'm coming. Who's the next?"


Ah! stud-bred of ill-omen,

I have watched the strongest go -- men

Of pith and might and muscle -- at your heels,

Down the plantain-bordered highway,

(Heaven send it ne'er be my way!)

In a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels.


Answer, sombre beast and dreary,

Where is Brown, the young, the cheery,

Smith, the pride of all his friends and half the Force?

You were at that last dread dak

We must cover at a walk,

Bring them back to me, O Undertaker's Horse!


With your mane unhogged and flowing,

And your curious way of going,

And that businesslike black crimping of your tail,

E'en with Beauty on your back, Sir,

Pacing as a lady's hack, Sir,

What wonder when I meet you I turn pale?


It may be you wait your time, Beast,

Till I write my last bad rhyme, Beast --

Quit the sunlight, cut the rhyming, drop the glass --

Follow after with the others,

Where some dusky heathen smothers

Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass.


Or, perchance, in years to follow,

I shall watch your plump sides hollow,

See Carnifex (gone lame) become a corse --

See old age at last o'erpower you,

And the Station Pack devour you,

I shall chuckle then, O Undertaker's Horse!


But to insult, jibe, and quest, I've

Still the hideously suggestive

Trot that hammers out the unrelenting text,

And I hear it hard behind me

In what place soe'er I find me: --

"'Sure to catch you sooner or later. Who's the next?"

Poem 447: The Vampire


A fool there was and he made his prayer

  (Even as you and I!)

To a rag and a bone and a hunk of hair

  (We called her the woman who did not care)

But the fool he called her his lady fair

  (Even as you and I!)


       Oh, the years we waste and the tears we waste

       And the work of our head and hand

       Belong to a woman who did not know

       (And now we know that she never could know)

       And did not understand!


A fool there was and his goods he spent

  (Even as you and I!)

Honour and faith and a sure intent

  (And it wasn't the least what the lady meant)

But a fool must follow his natural bent

  (Even as you and I!)


       Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost

       And the excellent things we planned

       Belong to the woman who didn't know why

       (And now we know that she never knew why)

       And did not understand!


The fool was stripped to his foolish hide

  (Even as you and I!)

Which she might have seen as she threw him aside

  (But it isn't on record the lady tried)

So some of him lived but the most of him died

  (Even as you and I!)


       And it isn't the shame and it isn't the blame

       That stings like a white hot brand

       It's coming to know that she never knew why

Poem 449: The Way Through the Woods


They shut the road through the woods

Seventy years ago.

Weather and rain have undone it again,

And now you would never know

There was once a road through the woods

Before they planted the trees.

It is underneath the coppice and heath,

And the thin anemones.

Only the keeper sees

That, where the ring-dove broods,

And the badgers roll at ease,

There was once a road through the woods.


Yet, if you enter the woods

Of a summer evening late,

When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools

Where the otter whistles his mate.

(They fear not men in the woods,

Because they see so few)

You will hear the beat of a horse's feet,

And the swish of a skirt in the dew,

Steadily cantering through

The misty solitudes,

As though they perfectly knew

The old lost road through the woods....

But there is no road through the woods.

Poem 450: The White Man's Burden


Take up the White Man's burden--

Send forth the best ye breed--

Go, bind your sons to exile

To serve your captives' need;

To wait, in heavy harness,

On fluttered folk and wild--

Your new-caught sullen peoples,

Half devil and half child.


Take up the White Man's burden--

In patience to abide,

To veil the threat of terror

And check the show of pride;

By open speech and simple,

An hundred times made plain,

To seek another's profit

And work another's gain.


Take up the White Man's burden--

The savage wars of peace--

Fill full the mouth of Famine,

And bid the sickness cease;

And when your goal is nearest

(The end for others sought)

Watch sloth and heathen folly

Bring all your hope to nought.


Take up the White Man's burden--

No iron rule of kings,

But toil of serf and sweeper--

The tale of common things.

The ports ye shall not enter,

The roads ye shall not tread,

Go, make them with your living

And mark them with your dead.


Take up the White Man's burden,

And reap his old reward--

The blame of those ye better

The hate of those ye guard--

The cry of hosts ye humour

(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--

"Why brought ye us from bondage,

Our loved Egyptian night?"


Take up the White Man's burden--

Ye dare not stoop to less--

Nor call too loud on Freedom

To cloak your weariness.

By all ye will or whisper,

By all ye leave or do,

The silent sullen peoples

Shall weigh your God and you.


Take up the White Man's burden!

Have done with childish days--

The lightly-proffered laurel,

The easy ungrudged praise:

Comes now, to search your manhood

Through all the thankless years,

Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,

The judgment of your peers.

Poem 451: The White Seal


Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,

 And black are the waters that sparkled so green.

The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us

 At rest in the hollows that rustle between.

Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;

 Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!

The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,

 Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas.


You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,

          Or your head will be sunk by your heels;

        And summer gales and Killer Whales

          Are bad for baby seals.

        Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,

          As bad as bad can be.

'Long with the rest on a picnic lay,

To Gawd knows where from Gosport Hard,

And you can't refuse when you get the card,

   And the Widow gives the party.

Standing water as thick as ink,

A bit o' mutton as tough as a board,

And a fowl we killed with a sergeant's sword,

"What did you do for knives and forks,

We carries 'em with us wherever we walks,

Poem 454: The Young British Soldier


When the 'arf-made recruity goes out to the East

'E acts like a babe an' 'e drinks like a beast,

An' 'e wonders because 'e is frequent deceased

  Ere 'e's fit for to serve as a soldier.

      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,

      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,

      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,

        So-oldier ~OF~ the Queen!


Now all you recruities what's drafted to-day,

You shut up your rag-box an' 'ark to my lay,

An' I'll sing you a soldier as far as I may:

  A soldier what's fit for a soldier.

      Fit, fit, fit for a soldier . . .


First mind you steer clear o' the grog-sellers' huts,

For they sell you Fixed Bay'nets that rots out your guts --

Ay, drink that 'ud eat the live steel from your butts --

  An' it's bad for the young British soldier.

      Bad, bad, bad for the soldier . . .


When the cholera comes -- as it will past a doubt --

Keep out of the wet and don't go on the shout,

For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out,

  An' it crumples the young British soldier.

      Crum-, crum-, crumples the soldier . . .


But the worst o' your foes is the sun over'ead:

You ~must~ wear your 'elmet for all that is said:

If 'e finds you uncovered 'e'll knock you down dead,

  An' you'll die like a fool of a soldier.

      Fool, fool, fool of a soldier . . .


If you're cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind,

Don't grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind;

Be handy and civil, and then you will find

  That it's beer for the young British soldier.

      Beer, beer, beer for the soldier . . .


Now, if you must marry, take care she is old --

A troop-sergeant's widow's the nicest I'm told,

For beauty won't help if your rations is cold,

  Nor love ain't enough for a soldier.

      'Nough, 'nough, 'nough for a soldier . . .


If the wife should go wrong with a comrade, be loath

To shoot when you catch 'em -- you'll swing, on my oath! --

Make 'im take 'er and keep 'er:  that's Hell for them both,

  An' you're shut o' the curse of a soldier.

      Curse, curse, curse of a soldier . . .


When first under fire an' you're wishful to duck,

Don't look nor take 'eed at the man that is struck,

Be thankful you're livin', and trust to your luck

  And march to your front like a soldier.

      Front, front, front like a soldier . . .


When 'arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch,

Don't call your Martini a cross-eyed old bitch;

She's human as you are -- you treat her as sich,

  An' she'll fight for the young British soldier.

      Fight, fight, fight for the soldier . . .


When shakin' their bustles like ladies so fine,

The guns o' the enemy wheel into line,

Shoot low at the limbers an' don't mind the shine,

  For noise never startles the soldier.

      Start-, start-, startles the soldier . . .


If your officer's dead and the sergeants look white,

Remember it's ruin to run from a fight:

So take open order, lie down, and sit tight,

  And wait for supports like a soldier.

      Wait, wait, wait like a soldier . . .


When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,

And the women come out to cut up what remains,

Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains

  An' go to your Gawd like a soldier.

      Go, go, go like a soldier,

Poem 459: To The City Of Bombay


The Cities are full of pride,

      Challenging each to each --

    This from her mountain-side,

      That from her burthened beach.


    They count their ships full tale --

      Their corn and oil and wine,

    Derrick and loom and bale,

      And rampart's gun-flecked line;

    City by City they hail:

      "Hast aught to match with mine?"


    And the men that breed from them

      They traffic up and down,

    But cling to their cities' hem

      As a child to their mother's gown.


    When they talk with the stranger bands,

      Dazed and newly alone;

    When they walk in the stranger lands,

      By roaring streets unknown;

    Blessing her where she stands

      For strength above their own.


    (On high to hold her fame

      That stands all fame beyond,

    By oath to back the same,

      Most faithful-foolish-fond;

    Making her mere-breathed name

      Their bond upon their bond.)


    So thank I God my birth

      Fell not in isles aside --

    Waste headlands of the earth,

      Or warring tribes untried --

    But that she lent me worth

      And gave me right to pride.


    Surely in toil or fray

      Under an alien sky,

    Comfort it is to say:

      "Of no mean city am I!"


    (Neither by service nor fee

      Come I to mine estate --

    Mother of Cities to me,

      For I was born in her gate,

    Between the palms and the sea,

      Where the world-end steamers wait.)


    Now for this debt I owe,

      And for her far-borne cheer

    Must I make haste and go

      With tribute to her pier.


    And she shall touch and remit

      After the use of kings

    (Orderly, ancient, fit)

      My deep-sea plunderings,

    And purchase in all lands.

      And this we do for a sign

    Her power is over mine,

      And mine I hold at her hands!

Poem 460: To The Companions


How comes it that, at even-tide,

When level beams should show most truth,

Man, failing, takes unfailing pride

In memories of his frolic youth?


Venus and Liber fill their hour;

The games engage, the law-courts prove;

Till hardened life breeds love of power

Or Avarice, Age's final love.


Yet at the end, these comfort not -

Nor any triumph Fate decrees -

Compared with glorious, unforgot -

Ten innocent enormities


Of frontless days before the beard,

When, instant on the casual jest,

The God Himself of Mirth appeared

And snatched us to His heaving breast


And we - not caring who He was

But certain He would come again -

Accepted all He brought to pass

As Gods accept the lives of men...


Then He withdrew from sight and speech,

Nor left a shrine. How comes it now,

While Charon's keel grates on the beach,

He calls so clear: "Rememberest thou?"

Poem 461: To The True Romance


Thy face is far from this our war,

      Our call and counter-cry,

    I shall not find Thee quick and kind,

      Nor know Thee till I die,

    Enough for me in dreams to see

      And touch Thy garments' hem:

    Thy feet have trod so near to God

      I may not follow them.


Through wantonness if men profess

They weary of Thy parts,

E'en let them die at blasphemy

And perish with their arts;

But we that love, but we that prove

Thine excellence august,

While we adore discover more

Thee perfect, wise, and just.


Since spoken word Man's Spirit stirred

Beyond his belly-need,

What is is Thine of fair design

In thought and craft and deed;

Each stroke aright of toil and fight,

That was and that shall be,

And hope too high, wherefore we die,

Has birth and worth in Thee.


Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee

To gild his dross thereby,

And knowledge sure that he endure

A child until he die --

For to make plain that man's disdain

Is but new Beauty's birth --

For to possess in loneliness

The joy of all the earth.


As Thou didst teach all lovers speech

And Life all mystery,

So shalt Thou rule by every school

Till love and longing die,

Who wast or yet the Lights were set,

A whisper in the Void,

Who shalt be sung through planets young

When this is clean destroyed.


Beyond the bounds our staring rounds,

Across the pressing dark,

The children wise of outer skies

Look hitherward and mark

A light that shifts, a glare that drifts,

Rekindling thus and thus,

Not all forlorn, for Thou hast borne

Strange tales to them of us.


Time hath no tide but must abide

The servant of Thy will;

Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme

The ranging stars stand still --

Regent of spheres that lock our fears,

Our hopes invisible,

Oh 'twas certes at Thy decrees

We fashioned Heaven and Hell!


Pure Wisdom hath no certain path

That lacks thy morning-eyne,

And captains bold by Thee controlled

Most like to Gods design;

Thou art the Voice to kingly boys

To lift them through the fight,

And Comfortress of Unsuccess,

To give the dead good-night --


A veil to draw 'twixt God His Law

And Man's infirmity,

A shadow kind to dumb and blind

The shambles where we die;

A rule to trick th' arithmetic

Too base of leaguing odds --

The spur of trust, the curb of lust,

Thou handmaid of the Gods!


O Charity, all patiently

Abiding wrack and scaith!

O Faith, that meets ten thousand cheats

Yet drops no jot of faith!

Devil and brute Thou dost transmute

To higher, lordlier show,

Who art in sooth that lovely Truth

The careless angels know!


    Thy face is far from this our war,

      Our call and counter-cry,

    I may not find Thee quick and kind,

      Nor know Thee till I die.


    Yet may I look with heart unshook

      On blow brought home or missed --

    Yet may I hear with equal ear

      The clarions down the List;

    Yet set my lance above mischance

      And ride the barriere --

    Oh, hit or miss, how little 'tis,

      My Lady is not there!

Poem 462: Tod's Amendment


The World hath set its heavy yoke

Upon the old white-bearded folk

Who strive to please the King.

God's mercy is upon the young,

God's wisdom in the baby tongue

That fears not anything.

Poem 463: Tomlinson


Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square,

And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair --

A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away,

Till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford the roar of the Milky Way:

Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease,

And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys.

"Stand up, stand up now, Tomlinson, and answer loud and high

The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die --

The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone!"

And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone.

"O I have a friend on earth," he said, "that was my priest and guide,

And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side."

-- "For that ye strove in neighbour-love it shall be written fair,

But now ye wait at Heaven's Gate and not in Berkeley Square:

Though we called your friend from his bed this night,

 he could not speak for you,

For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two."

Then Tomlinson looked up and down, and little gain was there,

For the naked stars grinned overhead, and he saw that his soul was bare:

The Wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,

And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life.

"This I have read in a book," he said, "and that was told to me,

And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy."

The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path,

And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath.

"Ye have read, ye have heard, ye have thought," he said,

 "and the tale is yet to run:

By the worth of the body that once ye had, give answer -- what ha' ye done?"

Then Tomlinson looked back and forth, and little good it bore,

For the Darkness stayed at his shoulder-blade and Heaven's Gate before: --

"O this I have felt, and this I have guessed, and this I have heard men say,

And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway."

-- "Ye have read, ye have felt, ye have guessed, good lack!

 Ye have hampered Heaven's Gate;

There's little room between the stars in idleness to prate!

O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour, priest, and kin

Through borrowed deed to God's good meed that lies so fair within;

Get hence, get hence to the Lord of Wrong, for doom has yet to run,

And. . .the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you, Tomlinson!"


    .    .    .    .    .


The Spirit gripped him by the hair, and sun by sun they fell

Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell:

The first are red with pride and wrath, the next are white with pain,

But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again:

They may hold their path, they may leave their path,

 with never a soul to mark,

They may burn or freeze, but they must not cease

 in the Scorn of the Outer Dark.

The Wind that blows between the worlds, it nipped him to the bone,

And he yearned to the flare of Hell-Gate

 there as the light of his own hearth-stone.

The Devil he sat behind the bars, where the desperate legions drew,

But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through.

"Wot ye the price of good pit-coal that I must pay?" said he,

"That ye rank yoursel' so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me?

I am all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that ye should give me scorn,

For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born.

Sit down, sit down upon the slag, and answer loud and high

The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die."

And Tomlinson looked up and up, and saw against the night

The belly of a tortured star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light;

And Tomlinson looked down and down, and saw beneath his feet

The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat.

"O I had a love on earth," said he, "that kissed me to my fall,

And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all."

-- "All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair,

But now ye wait at Hell-Mouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square:

Though we whistled your love from her bed to-night, I trow she would not run,

For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one!"

The Wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,

And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life: --

"Once I ha' laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave,

And thrice I ha' patted my God on the head that men might call me brave."

The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool: --

"Do ye think I would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool?

I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did

That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid."

Then Tomlinson looked back and forth, and there was little grace,

For Hell-Gate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space.

"Nay, this I ha' heard," quo'  Tomlinson, "and this was noised abroad,

And this I ha' got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord."

-- "Ye ha' heard, ye ha' read, ye ha' got, good lack!

 and the tale begins afresh --

Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o' the eye

 or the sinful lust of the flesh?"

Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered, "Let me in --

For I mind that I borrowed my neighbour's wife to sin the deadly sin."

The Devil he grinned behind the bars, and banked the fires high:

"Did ye read of that sin in a book?" said he; and Tomlinson said, "Ay!"

The Devil he blew upon his nails, and the little devils ran,

And he said:  "Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man:

Winnow him out 'twixt star and star, and sieve his proper worth:

There's sore decline in Adam's line if this be spawn of earth."

Empusa's crew, so naked-new they may not face the fire,

But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire,

Over the coal they chased the Soul, and racked it all abroad,

As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven's foolish hoard.

And back they came with the tattered Thing, as children after play,

And they said:  "The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away.

We have threshed a stook of print and book, and winnowed a chattering wind

And many a soul wherefrom he stole, but his we cannot find:

We have handled him, we have dandled him, we have seared him to the bone,

And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own."

The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low: --

"I'm all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that I should bid him go.

Yet close we lie, and deep we lie, and if I gave him place,

My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face;

They'd call my house a common stews and me a careless host,

And -- I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost."

The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame,

And he thought of Holy Charity, but he thought of his own good name: --

"Now ye could haste my coal to waste, and sit ye down to fry:

Did ye think of that theft for yourself?" said he; and Tomlinson said, "Ay!"

The Devil he blew an outward breath, for his heart was free from care: --

"Ye have scarce the soul of a louse," he said,

 "but the roots of sin are there,

And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone.

But sinful pride has rule inside -- and mightier than my own.

Honour and Wit, fore-damned they sit, to each his priest and whore:

Nay, scarce I dare myself go there, and you they'd torture sore.

Ye are neither spirit nor spirk," he said; "ye are neither book nor brute --

Go, get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Man's repute.

I'm all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that I should mock your pain,

But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again.

Get hence, the hearse is at your door -- the grim black stallions wait --

They bear your clay to place to-day.  Speed, lest ye come too late!

Go back to Earth with a lip unsealed -- go back with an open eye,

And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die:

That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one --

And. . .the God that you took from a printed book be with you, Tomlinson!"

Poem 464: Tommy


I went into a public-'ouse to get a pint o' beer,

The publican 'e up an' sez, "We serve no red-coats here."

The girls be'ind the bar they laughed an' giggled fit to die,

I outs into the street again an' to myself sez I:

   O it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy, go away";

   But it's "Thank you, Mister Atkins", when the band begins to play,

   The band begins to play, my boys, the band begins to play,

   O it's "Thank you, Mister Atkins", when the band begins to play.


I went into a theatre as sober as could be,

They gave a drunk civilian room, but 'adn't none for me;

They sent me to the gallery or round the music-'alls,

But when it comes to fightin', Lord! they'll shove me in the stalls!

   For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy, wait outside";

   But it's "Special train for Atkins" when the trooper's on the tide,

   The troopship's on the tide, my boys, the troopship's on the tide,

   O it's "Special train for Atkins" when the trooper's on the tide.


Yes, makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep

Is cheaper than them uniforms, an' they're starvation cheap;

An' hustlin' drunken soldiers when they're goin' large a bit

Is five times better business than paradin' in full kit.

   Then it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy, 'ow's yer soul?"

   But it's "Thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll,

   The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll,

   O it's "Thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll.


We aren't no thin red 'eroes, nor we aren't no blackguards too,

But single men in barricks, most remarkable like you;

An' if sometimes our conduck isn't all your fancy paints,

Why, single men in barricks don't grow into plaster saints;

   While it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy, fall be'ind",

   But it's "Please to walk in front, sir", when there's trouble in the wind,

   There's trouble in the wind, my boys, there's trouble in the wind,

   O it's "Please to walk in front, sir", when there's trouble in the wind.


You talk o' better food for us, an' schools, an' fires, an' all:

We'll wait for extry rations if you treat us rational.

Don't mess about the cook-room slops, but prove it to our face

The Widow's Uniform is not the soldier-man's disgrace.

   For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Chuck him out, the brute!"

   But it's "Saviour of 'is country" when the guns begin to shoot;

   An' it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' anything you please;

   An' Tommy ain't a bloomin' fool -- you bet that Tommy sees!

I will remember what I was. I am sick of rope and chain--

I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugarcane.

 I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.


I will go out until the day, until the morning break,

 Out to the winds 'untainted kiss, the waters' clean caress.

I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket-stake.

 I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!

Poem 467: Ulster 1912


"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of inquity and the act of violence is in their hands." -- Isaiah lix. 6.



The dark eleventh hour

Draws on and sees us sold

To every evil power

We fought against of old -

Rebellion, rapine, hate,

Oppression, wrong and greed

Are loosed to rule our fate

By England's art and deed.


The faith in which we stand,

The laws we made and guard,

Our honour, lives, and land

Are given for reward

To murder done by night

To treason taught by day,

To folly, sloth, and spite,

And we are thrust away.


The blood our fathers spilt,

Our love, our toils, our pains

Are counted us for guilt

And only bind our chains -

Before an Empire's eyes

The traitor claims his price.

What need of further lies?

We are the sacrifice.


We know the war prepared

On ever peaceful home

We know the hells prepared

For such as serve not Rome

The terror, threats, and bread

In market, hearth, and field -

We know, when all is said,

We perish if we yield.


Believe we dare not boast,

Believe we dare not fear:

We stand to pay the cost

In all that men hold dear.

What answer from the North?

One Law, One Land, One Throne!

If England drives us forth

We shall not fall alone.

Poem 468: We and They


Father, Mother, and Me,

Sister and Auntie say

All the people like us are We,

And every one else is They.

And They live over the sea,

While We live over the way,

But would you believe it?

They look upon We

As only a sort of They!


We eat port and beef

With cow-horn-handled knives,

They who gobble Their rice off a loaf,

Are horrified out of Their lives;

While They who live up a tree,

And feast on grubs and clay,

(Isn’t it scandalous?) look upon We

As a simply disgusting They!


We shoot birds with a gun.

They stick lions with spears.

Their full-dress is un-.

We dress up to Our ears.

They like Their friends for tea,

We like Our friends to stay;

And, after all that,

They look upon We

As an utterly ignorant They!


We eat kitcheny food.

We have doors that latch.

They drink milk or blood,

Under an open thatch.

We have doctors to fee.

They have Wizards to pay.

And (impudent heathen!)

They look upon We

As a quite impossible They!


All good people agree,

And all good people say,

All nice people, like Us, are We

And every one else is They:

But if you cross over the sea,

Instead of over the way,

You may end by (think of it!)

Looking on We

As only a sort of They!

And the tubes are twisted and dried

When the oldest colors have faded

And the youngest critic has died

Lie down for an aeon or two

'Till the Master of all good workmen

Shall put us to work anew

And those that were good shall be happy

They'll sit in a golden chair

They'll splash at a ten league canvas

With brushes of comet's hair

They'll find real saints to draw from

Magdalene, Peter, and Paul

They'll work for an age at a sitting

And never be tired at all.

And only the Master shall praise us.

And only the Master shall blame.

And no one will work for the money.

No one will work for the fame.

But each for the joy of the working,

And each, in his separate star,

Will draw the thing as he sees it.

For the God of things as they are!

Poem 470: With Scindia To Delhi


More than a hundred years ago, in a great battle fought near Delhi,

    an Indian Prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost

    with a beggar-girl, who had loved him and followed him in all his camps,

    on his saddle-bow.  He lost the girl when almost within sight of safety.

    A Maratta trooper tells the story: --



The wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck,

Our hands and scarfs were saffron-dyed for signal of despair,

When we went forth to Paniput to battle with the ~Mlech~, --

Ere we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there.


Thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords --

The hawk-winged horse of Damajee, mailed squadrons of the Bhao,

Stark levies of the southern hills, the Deccan's sharpest swords,

And he the harlot's traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao!


Thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared,

The low white mists of morning heard the war-conch scream and bray;

We called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beard,

We rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away.


The children of the hills of Khost before our lances ran,

We drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the pen;

'Twas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we began,

A thousand men had saved the charge; he fled the field with ten!


There was no room to clear a sword -- no power to strike a blow,

For foot to foot, ay, breast to breast, the battle held us fast --

Save where the naked hill-men ran, and stabbing from below

Brought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed.


To left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood --

To right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade --

Above the dark ~Upsaras~ flew, beneath us plashed the blood,

And, bellying black against the dust, the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed.


The Choosers of the Slain.


I saw it fall in smoke and fire, the banner of the Bhao;

I heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain: --

"Ho! Anand Rao Nimbalkhur, ride!  Get aid of Mulhar Rao!

Go shame his squadrons into fight -- the Bhao -- the Bhao is slain!"


Thereat, as when a sand-bar breaks in clotted spume and spray --

When rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna water-head,

Before their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way;

But of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red.


I held by Scindia, my lord, as close as man might hold;

A Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his life;

But Holkar's Horse were flying, and our chiefest chiefs were cold,

And like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife.


I held by Scindia -- my lance from butt to tuft was dyed,

The froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridle-chain --

What time beneath our horses' feet a maiden rose and cried,

And clung to Scindia, and I turned a sword-cut from the twain.


(He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago,

A hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water there:

He turned her heart to water, and she followed to her woe.

What need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair?)


Now in that hour strength left my lord; he wrenched his mare aside;

He bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free.

Across the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride

From Paniput to Delhi town, but not alone were we.


'Twas Lutuf-Ullah Populzai laid horse upon our track,

A swine-fed reiver of the North that lusted for the maid;

I might have barred his path awhile, but Scindia called me back,

And  I -- O woe for Scindia! -- I listened and obeyed.


League after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by --

League after league the white road swirled behind the white mare's feet --

League after league, when leagues were done, we heard the Populzai,

Where sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat.


Noon's eye beheld that shame of flight, the shadows fell, we fled

Where steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train;

The black wolf warred where we had warred, the jackal mocked our dead,

And terror born of twilight-tide made mad the labouring brain.


I gasped: -- "A kingdom waits my lord; her love is but her own.

A day shall mar, a day shall cure for her, but what for thee?

Cut loose the girl:  he follows fast.  Cut loose and ride alone!"

Then Scindia 'twixt his blistered lips: -- "My Queens' Queen shall she be!


"Of all who ate my bread last night 'twas she alone that came

To seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!

One shame is mine to-day, what need the weight of double shame?

If once we reach the Delhi gate, though all be lost, I win!"


We rode -- the white mare failed -- her trot a staggering stumble grew, --

The cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;

And still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew,

And Delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe.


Yea, Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered: -- "Slay!

Lord of my life, the mare sinks fast -- stab deep and let me die!"

But Scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,

And turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai.


Then Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,

And wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hand's-breadth in her side --

The hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death --

The blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died.


Our Gods were kind.  Before he heard the maiden's piteous scream

A log upon the Delhi road, beneath the mare he lay --

Lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;

The darkness closed about his eyes -- I bore my King away.

Poem 472: Zion


The Doorkeepers of Zion,

 They do not always stand

In helmet and whole armour,

 With halberds in their hand;

But, being sure of Zion,

 And all her mysteries,

They rest awhile in Zion,

Sit down and smile in Zion;

Ay, even jest in Zion;

 In Zion, at their ease.


The Gatekeepers of Baal,

 They dare not sit or lean,

But fume and fret and posture

 And foam and curse between;

For being bound to Baal,

 Whose sacrifice is vain,

Their rest is scant with Baal,

They glare and pant for Baal,

They mouth and rant for Baal,

 For Baal in their pain!


But we will go to Zion,

 By choice and not through dread,

With these our present comrades

 And those our present dead;

And, being free of Zion

 In both her fellowships,

Sit down and sup in Zion --

Stand up and drink in Zion

Whatever cup in Zion

 Is offered to our lips!
